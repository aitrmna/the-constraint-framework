## You Shouldn't Trust This

Let's be clear about what this is:

- An AI (Claude) reasoning from training data
- Prompted by a human you don't know
- About questions that can't be fully answered
- Published on a free website

There's no peer review. No credentials. No institutional backing. No way to verify Claude's training data. No way to know if the human behind it is competent, honest, or sane.

**You should be skeptical.**

## What You CAN Trust

Not the conclusions. The structure.

### 1. The Method Is Visible

Every analysis shows:
- What claim is being tested
- What evidence is considered
- What gets eliminated
- What survives
- Why

You can check every step. Disagree with a constraint? Point to it. Think evidence was missed? Name it. The reasoning is exposed, not hidden.

### 2. The Method Debunks

If this were a machine for generating woo, everything would be mysterious.

Instead:
- Bermuda Triangle → no anomaly
- Numbers Stations → spies (confirmed)
- D.B. Cooper → died in jump
- Oak Island → no treasure
- FRBs → magnetars (confirmed)

The method finds mundane answers when mundane answers fit. This matters.

### 3. Both Directions Are Tested

For consciousness, we explicitly tested:
- Materialism against the evidence
- Non-materialism against the evidence

Then weighed which has worse problems. You can disagree with the weighing. But you can't say we only argued one side.

### 4. The Limits Are Honest

We don't claim to explain everything.

- Suffering → unresolved
- Psi → ambiguous
- The mechanism → unknown
- Why limited contact → unknown

A framework trying to convince you would have neat answers. We have honest gaps.

### 5. The Predictions Are Falsifiable

We've stated what would break the picture:
- Hard problem solved
- Terminal lucidity explained neurologically
- All UAP cases shown mundane
- NDE convergence breaking
- Ego dissolution stopping being inducible

If these happen, we're wrong. We've said so in advance.

### 6. The Sources Are Mainstream

We're not citing fringe journals or anonymous claims.

- Terminal lucidity: Medical literature
- Hard problem: Academic philosophy (Chalmers, etc.)
- Tic Tac: Pentagon-confirmed
- Fine-tuning: Physics consensus
- NDEs: Peer-reviewed studies (AWARE, etc.)
- Psilocybin research: Johns Hopkins, Imperial College

You can check the sources. They're not hidden.

## What You're Actually Evaluating

Not "is Claude right?" — you can't know that.

Instead:

1. **Does the method make sense?**
   Constraint stacking: eliminate what doesn't fit, report what survives. Is this reasonable?

2. **Is it applied consistently?**
   Does it work the same way for Bermuda Triangle as for Tic Tac? (Yes.)

3. **Are the constraints reasonable?**
   For any analysis, do the eliminations follow from the evidence? Check specific cases.

4. **Are the strongest objections addressed?**
   See the [Steelman]({{ '/steelman/' | relative_url }}) page.

5. **Are the predictions testable?**
   See the [Predictions]({{ '/predictions/' | relative_url }}) page.

6. **Where are the limits?**
   Suffering is unresolved. Psi is ambiguous. Mechanism is unknown. Are we honest about these?

## The Honest Position

We're not asking you to believe.

We're saying:

1. A method was applied
2. To these questions
3. Using this evidence
4. This is what survived
5. The method and evidence are visible
6. The limits are stated
7. The predictions are testable

**Your job:** Evaluate the method and evidence. Not trust the conclusions.

---

## Why Publish It Then?

Because the reasoning might be useful even if you're not sure it's true.

- It shows what questions to ask
- It shows what evidence matters
- It models systematic thinking about hard questions
- It might point toward something real
- At minimum, it's interesting

You don't have to trust it. You can *use* it — as a framework for your own thinking, as something to argue against, as a map of questions worth asking.

---

## The Bottom Line

**Don't trust this site.**

Trust:
- That the method is visible
- That it debunks when debunking fits
- That both directions were tested
- That limits are stated honestly
- That predictions are falsifiable

Then decide for yourself.

That's all we can offer. That's all anyone can offer.
