## If You're Skeptical, Good

You should be. This site makes some uncomfortable claims. Don't take them on faith.

Instead, look at three cases. They're chosen because they're hard to dismiss without engaging the specifics.

---

## Case 1: The Tic Tac

**What happened:** November 2004, USS Nimitz carrier group. For two weeks, radar tracked objects dropping from 80,000 feet to sea level in seconds. Commander David Fravor visually encountered a 40-foot white object — no wings, no exhaust. It mirrored his movements, then vanished, reappearing 60 miles away at his classified return destination.

**Why it's hard to dismiss:**
- Five independent sensor systems (ship radar, airborne radar, aircraft radar, infrared video, visual)
- Four Navy pilots plus radar operators
- 14 days of tracking
- Pentagon confirmed
- Physics: 175g+ acceleration (humans die at 10g, best aircraft max 15g)

**The constraint stacking result:** Every mundane explanation gets eliminated by at least one piece of evidence. What survives: technology using physics we don't understand.

## Case 2: Terminal Lucidity

**What happens:** Patients with severe dementia or brain damage — people who haven't recognized family members in years, whose brains show 90%+ tissue destruction — suddenly become completely lucid shortly before death. Clear conversation, accurate memories, recognition of loved ones. Then they die.

**Why it's hard to dismiss:**
- Documented in medical literature since the 1800s
- The brain damage is still present — neurons don't regenerate
- No proposed mechanism after 200 years of documentation
- If brain = consciousness, this shouldn't happen

**The constraint stacking result:** If consciousness is produced by the brain, damaged brain means damaged consciousness. Always. Terminal lucidity violates this. What survives: consciousness isn't fully explained by brain state.

## Case 3: The Bermuda Triangle

**What happened:** The Bermuda Triangle is famous for mysterious disappearances of ships and aircraft.

**Why this case matters:** It shows the method debunks.

**The constraint stacking result:** 
- Lloyd's of London insurance data: No elevated risk in the region
- Coast Guard: No unusual number of incidents given traffic volume
- Famous cases: Have mundane explanations when investigated
- **There is no anomaly.** The "mystery" is a statistical artifact and media hype.

## What These Three Show

| Case | Result | What It Proves |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Tic Tac | Non-human technology survives | The method finds anomalies when they exist |
| Terminal Lucidity | Materialism has problems | The method challenges mainstream assumptions |
| Bermuda Triangle | No anomaly exists | The method debunks when debunking fits |

**The method is neutral.** It doesn't favor exotic conclusions. It finds what survives elimination.

## If You're Still Here

These three cases are representative. There are 33 total, across five categories.

**Next steps:**

<p><a href="{{ '/mysteries/uap/' | relative_url }}">More UAP cases →</a> (6 total, same pattern)</p>

<p><a href="{{ '/mysteries/consciousness/' | relative_url }}">More consciousness cases →</a> (11 total, including death, self, free will)</p>

<p><a href="{{ '/mysteries/historical/' | relative_url }}">More debunking →</a> (5 of 7 historical cases resolve to mundane)</p>

Or jump to what emerges when you look at all 33 together:

## If You're Not Convinced

That's fine. The [Steelman]({{ '/steelman/' | relative_url }}) page addresses the strongest objections. The [Why Trust This?]({{ '/trust/' | relative_url }}) page explains why you probably shouldn't trust it — and what you can evaluate instead.

The point isn't to convince you. It's to show the reasoning clearly enough that you can engage with it.
