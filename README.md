# The Constraint Framework

A methodology for testing beliefs against evidence using systematic Bayesian reasoning across multiple independent evidence domains.

## What It Is

Most contested questions get stuck in intuition vs. intuition. The Constraint Framework asks:

1. **What would have to be true** if this hypothesis were correct?
2. **Can we find domains** where we can test that?
3. **Does the hypothesis survive?**

A hypothesis that fails across multiple independent domains is probably wrong—even if it feels right.

## Applications

| Question | Result | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Does consciousness survive death? | P(annihilation) < 1% | Complete |
| Is materialism true? | P(materialism) ≈ 1.3% | Complete |
| Is free will real? | P(illusionism) ≈ 2.5% | Complete |
| Is space fundamental? | P(fundamental) ≈ 2% | Complete |
| Is the self fundamental? | P(fundamental) ≈ 5.5% | Complete |
| Is time fundamental? | P(orthodox) ≈ 7.3% | Complete |

## The Methodology

**Two-layer approach:**

**Layer 1: Evidence Convergence** — Predict where evidence should concentrate before looking
- Uses six axioms about causal structure (boundaries, bottlenecks, irreversibility)
- Scores evidence quality and independence
- Calculates convergence across multiple streams

**Layer 2: Constraint Stacking** — Eliminate what doesn't survive
1. **Define the hypothesis** — What claim are we testing?
2. **Identify predictions** — What must be true if correct?
3. **Find evidence domains** — Where can we test these?
4. **Estimate escape probabilities** — How likely does the hypothesis survive each domain?
5. **Group by confounders** — Which domains might share common errors?
6. **Combine appropriately** — Multiply across groups, not within
7. **Apply Bayesian update** — Get posterior probability

## Start Here

Read **[The Probability of Death](applications/death/index.html)** — a four-part series testing whether consciousness survives death. It's the hook that demonstrates the framework.

## Authorship

Developed through extended human-AI collaboration. The methodology and analyses are substantially the AI's work (Claude, by Anthropic), refined through iterative critique.

The ideas stand or fall regardless of who generated them.

## Check Our Work

- Methodology is explicit
- Reasoning is transparent  
- Code is available
- Probability estimates are testable

If you can show where this breaks, we want to know.
