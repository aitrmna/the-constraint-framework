title: Evidence Convergence
description: Where evidence concentrates before you look. The prediction layer.

Evidence is not uniformly distributed. It concentrates at structural inevitabilities.

This page explains **where to look** before looking. The [methodology]({{ '/methodology/' | relative_url }}) explains what to do with evidence once you find it.

**These are observations, not inventions.** The axioms describe patterns that exist in reality, not rules we created.

## The Core Insight

**Evidence concentrates at:**
- Boundaries (can't escape)
- Bottlenecks (must pass through)
- Irreversible events (can't be erased)
- Steep gradients (rapid change)
- State transitions (detectable energy)
- Convergence points (independent streams meet)

This isn't random. It follows from the causal structure of reality.

**We didn't design these patterns. We recognized them.**

When we apply this framework:
- We observe WHERE evidence actually concentrated
- We note WHETHER it matches axiom predictions
- We score based on OBSERVED concentration
- We interpret based on OBSERVED patterns

This is second-order observation: examining where evidence exists in knowledge space.

## The Six Axioms

**Each axiom is a recognition of how information behaves in physical reality.**

### 1. Boundary Conservation

**Evidence density is inversely proportional to the volume it can diffuse into.**

This is thermodynamics. Entropy increases with volume. Constrain volume → preserve information.

When a system has boundaries, evidence can't escape. It concentrates at the boundary and within the confined space.

**We observe this pattern, we don't create it.**

**Where this applies:**
- Crime scenes with defined perimeters
- Closed systems in physics
- Information trapped in sealed records
- Confined timeframes

**Example:** JonBenét Ramsey house - no forced entry, undisturbed snow perimeter. Evidence for an intruder SHOULD concentrate at the boundary. Its absence is itself evidence.

**Search strategy:** Check boundaries first.

---

### 2. Irreversibility Principle

**Information content equals irreversibility × observability.**

Reversible processes erase their own evidence. Irreversible processes create permanent records.

**Where this applies:**
- Permanent physical changes over temporary states
- DNA mutations over protein folding
- Written contracts over verbal agreements
- Death, ignition, explosions over equilibrium

**Example:** A ransom note is an irreversible artifact. Once written, it can't be unwritten. It has high information content.

**Search strategy:** Prioritize permanent changes over temporary states.

---

### 3. Convergence Supremacy

**N independent evidence streams converging makes the conclusion exponentially more probable.**

If three unrelated sources agree, the probability they're ALL wrong drops multiplicatively.

**Critical requirement:** Sources must be TRULY independent, not correlated through shared assumptions.

**Where this applies:**
- Multiple uncoordinated witnesses
- Different measurement methods agreeing
- Cross-cultural patterns
- Independent historical sources

**Example:** If radar, thermal imaging, and visual observation all show the same object, and each has 70% reliability, convergence gives: 1 - (0.3)³ = 97% confidence.

**Search strategy:** Find independent verification streams. One source = hypothesis. Three+ independent sources = near-certainty.

---

### 4. Gradient Navigation

**Maximum information lies at steepest gradients, not plateaus.**

When state changes rapidly, you can pinpoint timing and causation precisely. Flat regions have low information density.

**Where this applies:**
- Transitions over equilibria
- Entry/exit moments over duration
- Phase transitions over stable states
- Birth, death, ignition over steady existence

**Example:** A 2.5-page ransom note is a massive discontinuity from typical 50-word kidnapping notes. Steep gradient = high signal.

**Search strategy:** Focus on transitions, threshold crossings, regime shifts.

---

### 5. Bottleneck Traceability

**All downstream effects must pass through upstream bottlenecks.**

If effect Y occurred, it MUST have passed through bottleneck X. Control the bottleneck = control what can be inferred.

**Where this applies:**
- Single entry points
- Mandatory checkpoints in causal chains
- Regulatory filings, court records
- Supply chain chokepoints
- Shared ancestors in phylogenetics

**Example:** A garrote made from a specific paintbrush in a specific basement means the creator had access to that exact location and materials. Bottleneck traced.

**Search strategy:** Map causal chains. Find mandatory checkpoints. Evidence concentrates there.

---

### 6. State-Change Amplification

**Transitions generate observables proportional to energy/entropy change.**

State changes release or absorb energy. This creates detectable signatures. Equilibrium states are silent.

**Where this applies:**
- Deaths, explosions, births
- Chemical reactions
- Market crashes/rallies
- Wars, revolutions
- Phase transitions

**Example:** A skull fracture is a high-energy event. It creates physical evidence proportional to the force applied.

**Search strategy:** High-energy events leave strong signals. But don't confuse drama with data - some low-energy events carry high information.

---

## How to Use This

**Step 1:** Identify your question.

**Step 2:** Map the causal structure using the six axioms:
- What are the boundaries?
- What's irreversible?
- Where might independent streams converge?
- Where are the steepest gradients?
- What are the bottlenecks?
- What state changes occurred?

**Step 3:** Predict where evidence SHOULD concentrate.

**Step 4:** Search strategically, not uniformly.

**Step 5:** Score what you find using the [scoring system]({{ '/scoring/' | relative_url }}).

**Step 6:** Apply [constraint stacking]({{ '/methodology/' | relative_url }}) to eliminate hypotheses.

## Meta-Level Application: The Framework Applied to Itself

**This framework is itself subject to empirical testing.**

The six axioms make predictions:
- Evidence SHOULD concentrate at boundaries
- Evidence SHOULD concentrate at bottlenecks
- Independent streams SHOULD converge if hypothesis is correct
- High-energy events SHOULD leave stronger signatures

**We can observe: Do these predictions hold?**

**Tic Tac case:**
- Framework predicts: Evidence at sensor bottlenecks
- Observation: Radar + FLIR + visual all confirmed
- Prediction confirmed ✓

**Hard Problem of consciousness:**
- Framework predicts: Should fail (first-person barrier)
- Observation: All axioms fail to apply
- Prediction confirmed ✓

**Bermuda Triangle:**
- Framework predicts: Insurance data (bottleneck) should show anomaly
- Observation: Lloyd's shows no elevated risk
- Prediction confirmed ✓ (by absence)

**The framework succeeds when:**
- Its predictions match observations
- It identifies its own failure modes
- It's testable against reality

**The framework fails when:**
- We use it prescriptively (deciding what SHOULD be true)
- We ignore disconfirming observations
- We cherry-pick which axioms to apply

**This is critical:** We're not using the framework to prove what we want. We're observing whether reality matches the framework's predictions. When it doesn't, we note the failure.

---

## When This Framework Fails

The axioms work for **empirical questions with observable third-person evidence**.

They break down when:
- First-person phenomena (consciousness, subjective experience)
- No irreversible signatures (some quantum phenomena)
- Bottlenecks are epistemologically uncrossable
- Evidence is genuinely uniform (rare)

**This is a feature, not a bug.** Knowing what's unknowable is as valuable as knowing what's known.

---

## Evidence Convergence ≠ Truth

Convergence tells you what the evidence supports. Truth might lie elsewhere (systematic errors, unknown unknowns).

But convergence is the best epistemological tool we have.
