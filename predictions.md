## What Would We Expect?

If the picture is right — consciousness fundamental, self constructed, the phenomenon real, time appearance — what should we see going forward?

Strong frameworks predict. Here's what this one predicts.

## Predictions

### On Consciousness

| Prediction | Timeframe | How to Test |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| The hard problem will not be solved within materialism | Ongoing | Watch neuroscience. If someone explains HOW matter produces experience (not just correlates), picture is wrong. |
| Terminal lucidity will remain unexplained by neuroscience | Ongoing | If mechanism found for clear mind from destroyed brain, picture is damaged. |
| NDE research will continue showing verified perception during flatline | Ongoing | AWARE III and similar studies. If all cases explained by residual brain activity, picture is damaged. |

**The bet:** Materialism will keep generating anomalies it can't explain. If it suddenly starts explaining them, we're wrong.

### On Self

| Prediction | Timeframe | How to Test |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Meditation and psychedelics will reliably produce ego dissolution | Testable now | Continued research at Johns Hopkins, Imperial College, etc. If effects stop replicating, picture is damaged. |
| Ego dissolution will correlate with reduced Default Mode Network activity | Testable now | Neuroimaging studies. This is already confirmed — prediction is it will hold. |
| Long-term meditators will show persistent DMN changes | Testable now | Already some evidence. Prediction: will strengthen. |

**The bet:** The self is a process that can be interrupted. Interrupting it will keep working.

### On the Phenomenon

| Prediction | Timeframe | How to Test |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| UAP encounters will continue with similar patterns | Ongoing | New cases will show same features: radar-visual, physics-defying maneuvers, apparent interest in nuclear/military. |
| Historical and modern contact will show structural similarities | Testable now | Compare Fatima, modern UAP, DMT entities, contact experiences. Pattern should hold. |
| Disclosure will accelerate but never complete | 5-10 years | If government fully discloses and it's just foreign drones, picture is wrong. If disclosure stays partial and weird, picture holds. |

**The bet:** The phenomenon is real and will keep appearing. If it stops, or is fully explained mundanely, we're wrong.

### On Afterlife Structure

| Prediction | Timeframe | How to Test |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| NDE accounts will continue converging on similar structure | Ongoing | Life review, beings, light, boundary — should remain consistent across cultures. |
| Reincarnation cases will continue emerging with verified details | Ongoing | Tucker's work continues. If cases stop or all are debunked, picture is damaged. |
| Cross-cultural consistency will hold | Ongoing | NDEs from isolated cultures should match Western patterns on core features. |

**The bet:** The afterlife has structure. Reports will keep converging, not diverging.

---

### On Time

| Prediction | Timeframe | How to Test |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Altered states will consistently report time distortion | Testable now | Psychedelics, deep meditation, NDEs — time should reliably become non-linear. |
| Precognition studies will continue showing small effects | Ongoing | Effects won't strengthen but won't disappear either. Frustratingly ambiguous. |
| Physics will not find fundamental time flow | Ongoing | If physics discovers privileged "now," picture is damaged. |

**The bet:** Time as we experience it is constructed. States that alter construction will alter time experience.

---

### On Psi

| Prediction | Timeframe | How to Test |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Psi effects will persist in meta-analyses | Ongoing | Small effects above chance will continue appearing. |
| Effects won't strengthen under tighter controls | Ongoing | The frustrating pattern will continue. |
| No one will win definitive psi prize | 5-10 years | Reliable, on-demand psi won't emerge. |

**The bet:** Psi is real but weak and uncontrollable. This ambiguous pattern will persist.

## How to Break the Picture

The picture is wrong if:

**Consciousness:**
- Hard problem is solved (mechanism for experience found)
- Terminal lucidity explained neurologically
- All NDEs shown to be constructed memories with no verified perception

**Self:**
- Ego dissolution stops being inducible
- Continuity of self proven (not just assumed)

**Phenomenon:**
- All UAP cases explained mundanely
- Contact experiences stop or are fully explained as psychology
- Pattern breaks — new cases don't match historical

**Afterlife:**
- NDE reports stop converging
- All reincarnation cases debunked
- Traditions shown to have no independent commonality

**Time:**
- Physics finds fundamental flow
- Altered states stop distorting time perception

**Psi:**
- Effects disappear entirely from meta-analyses
- OR effects become strong and reliable (would require model update)

## The Point

We're not hiding behind unfalsifiability.

These predictions can be tested. Some are being tested now. If they fail, the picture is wrong.

That's how honest inquiry works.
