<h1>I got curious. I asked Claude.</h1>

<p>What happens when you apply systematic elimination to hard questions — about consciousness, death, reality, UAPs, the phenomenon that's been contacting humanity throughout history?</p>

<p>This site is the result. Not claims. Not beliefs. Just: here's the method, here's the evidence, here's what survives.</p>

<p>Some mysteries dissolve into boring explanations. Some resist everything you throw at them. Some hit edges we can't resolve. All of it is interesting.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Method: Constraint Stacking</h2>

<ol>
  <li>List all plausible explanations</li>
  <li>Order evidence by eliminative power (most damning first)</li>
  <li>Apply constraints top-down — watch explanations get eliminated</li>
  <li>Report what survives</li>
</ol>

<p>We're not saying "X is true." We're saying "We eliminated everything except X."</p>

<div class="app-grid">

  <a href="{{ '/mysteries/foundations/' | relative_url }}" class="app-card">
    <h3>Foundations</h3>

<h2>The Pattern</h2>

<p>33 mysteries. 5 categories. What emerges when you zoom out?</p>

<div class="app-grid">
  <a href="{{ '/meta/' | relative_url }}" class="app-card">
    <h3>Site-Wide Meta</h3>
    <p>Historical → mundane. UAP, consciousness, foundations → resist mundane. Suffering → unresolved. The pattern points somewhere. The edges test it.</p>
    <span class="result">Do you see it?</span>
  </a>
</div>

<h2>What This Is</h2>

<p>I prompted. Claude responded. The reasoning is explicit. The methodology is transparent. The edges are honest.</p>

<p>If it sparks curiosity, good. If you disagree and can point to why, even better.</p>
