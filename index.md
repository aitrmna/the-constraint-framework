<h1>I got curious. I asked Claude.</h1>

<p>What happens when you apply systematic elimination to hard questions — about consciousness, death, reality, UAPs?</p>

<p>Some mysteries dissolve into boring explanations. Some resist everything you throw at them. I wanted to know which was which.</p>

<p>This site is the result. Not claims. Not beliefs. Just: here's the method, here's the evidence, here's what survives.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Skeptical? Start Here</h2>

<p>Three cases that show what the method does — one anomaly, one challenge to mainstream thinking, one debunk.</p>

<p><a href="{{ '/start/' | relative_url }}" class="app-card" style="display: block; max-width: 400px;">
  <h3>Start Here →</h3>
  <p>The Tic Tac. Terminal Lucidity. The Bermuda Triangle. See if the reasoning holds up.</p>
</a></p>

<hr>

<h2>The Method: Constraint Stacking</h2>

<ol>
  <li>List all plausible explanations</li>
  <li>Order evidence by eliminative power (most damning first)</li>
  <li>Apply constraints top-down — watch explanations get eliminated</li>
  <li>Report what survives</li>
</ol>

<p>We're not saying "X is true." We're saying "We eliminated everything except X."</p>

<h2>All Mysteries</h2>

    <h3>UAP</h3>
    <p>Six military encounters. The Fermi Paradox.</p>

<h2>What Emerged</h2>

<p>33 mysteries through one method. A pattern appeared — some categories resist mundane explanation, others don't. Whether that means anything is up to you.</p>

<p><a href="{{ '/meta/' | relative_url }}">See the pattern →</a></p>

<hr>

<h2>What This Is</h2>

<p>I prompted. Claude responded. The reasoning is explicit. The edges are honest.</p>

<p>If it sparks curiosity, good. If you disagree and can point to why, even better.</p>
