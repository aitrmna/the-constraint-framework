<h1>Historical Mysteries: Meta-Constraint Analysis</h1>

Seven historical mysteries. Different eras, different types, different evidence. What patterns emerge when we apply constraint stacking across all of them?

---

## The Cases

| Case | Claim Tested | Result |
|------|--------------|--------|
| [Dyatlov Pass]({{ '/mysteries/dyatlov/' | relative_url }}) | What killed nine hikers? | Cannot eliminate: natural causes (avalanche + wind) |
| [Oak Island]({{ '/mysteries/oak-island/' | relative_url }}) | Is there buried treasure? | Cannot eliminate: no treasure (industrial site) |
| [D.B. Cooper]({{ '/mysteries/db-cooper/' | relative_url }}) | Did he survive? | Cannot eliminate: died in jump |
| [Mary Celeste]({{ '/mysteries/mary-celeste/' | relative_url }}) | What happened to crew? | Cannot eliminate: abandoned ship (alcohol fumes fear) |
| [Bermuda Triangle]({{ '/mysteries/bermuda-triangle/' | relative_url }}) | Is it anomalous? | Cannot eliminate: statistical artifact (no real anomaly) |
| [Voynich Manuscript]({{ '/mysteries/voynich/' | relative_url }}) | Is it meaningful? | Cannot eliminate: genuine unknown language |
| [Zodiac Killer]({{ '/mysteries/zodiac/' | relative_url }}) | Who was he? | Multiple suspects remain viable |

## The Pattern: Most "Mysteries" Have Mundane Explanations

**5 of 7 cases resolve to mundane explanations:**

| Case | Popular Theory | What Survives |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| Dyatlov Pass | Military test, Yeti, UFO | Avalanche + hypothermia |
| Oak Island | Pirate treasure, Templar gold | No treasure |
| D.B. Cooper | Successful escape | Died in jump |
| Mary Celeste | Pirates, sea monsters | Crew error (feared explosion) |
| Bermuda Triangle | Mysterious force | No anomaly at all |

**The pattern:** Constraint stacking tends to eliminate exotic explanations and leave mundane ones.

This isn't because the method is biased toward mundane. It's because exotic explanations usually require more assumptions and fail more constraints.

---

## The Exceptions

**Voynich Manuscript:** Constraints eliminate simple hoax but leave genuine mystery. The manuscript has statistical properties of real language, but we can't read it. Mundane (hoax) was eliminated; mystery remains.

**Zodiac Killer:** Constraints narrow but don't converge. Multiple suspects remain viable. This isn't resolution — it's genuine uncertainty due to insufficient evidence.

---

## Contrast with UAP Cases

| Historical Mysteries | UAP Mysteries |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Most resolve to mundane | All resist mundane explanation |
| Exotic claims usually fail | Mundane claims eliminated |
| Pattern: legends exaggerate | Pattern: military underreported |
| Century+ old, limited records | Recent, extensive documentation |

**Why the difference?**

Historical mysteries often suffer from:
- Time degradation of evidence
- Sensationalized retellings
- Selection bias (boring explanations don't become famous)

UAP cases (our selection) have:
- Modern instrumentation (radar, FLIR)
- Multiple independent sensors
- Official documentation
- Trained military observers

**The method doesn't predetermine outcomes.** It follows evidence. Historical mysteries often have worse evidence, so they resolve to "probably mundane." UAP cases have harder evidence that eliminates mundane explanations.

---

## What This Demonstrates About Constraint Stacking

**The method works in both directions:**

- When exotic explanations fail → mundane survives (Bermuda Triangle)
- When mundane explanations fail → exotic survives (Tic Tac)
- When nothing converges → genuine uncertainty (Zodiac)

**This is what honest methodology looks like.** We don't always get satisfying answers. Sometimes the answer is "probably nothing special." Sometimes it's "genuinely anomalous." Sometimes it's "we don't know."

---

## The Meta-Constraint

Across seven historical mysteries:

- **5 mundane explanations survive**
- **1 genuine unknown survives** (Voynich)
- **1 doesn't converge** (Zodiac)

**If constraint stacking were biased toward exotic conclusions, we wouldn't see this pattern.** The method is neutral — it just eliminates what the evidence eliminates.

The fact that most historical mysteries resolve to mundane answers while UAP mysteries don't is itself informative. It's not about the method. It's about the evidence.
