<h1>Signal Mysteries: Meta-Constraint Analysis</h1>

Three signal mysteries. Different sources, different eras, different characteristics. What survives constraint stacking?

---

## The Cases

| Case | Signal Type | Result |
|------|-------------|--------|
| [Wow! Signal]({{ '/mysteries/wow-signal/' | relative_url }}) | One-time radio burst (1977) | Cannot eliminate: ET OR unknown natural |
| [Fast Radio Bursts]({{ '/mysteries/fast-radio-bursts/' | relative_url }}) | Repeating radio bursts (2007+) | Cannot eliminate: magnetars (natural confirmed) |
| [Numbers Stations]({{ '/mysteries/numbers-stations/' | relative_url }}) | Ongoing shortwave broadcasts | Cannot eliminate: spy communication (proven) |

---

## The Pattern: Different Certainty Levels

**One case resolved (spy comms):**
- Numbers Stations: Court evidence proves Cuban stations are spy communication
- Not mysterious — just classified

**One case partially resolved (natural source found):**
- Fast Radio Bursts: At least one traced to magnetar
- Natural explanation exists, likely applies to most/all

**One case genuinely unresolved:**
- Wow! Signal: Single event, never repeated
- Natural and artificial both remain viable

---

## What This Shows About Signal Analysis

**Signals with ongoing examples resolve faster:**
- FRBs: Hundreds detected → eventually one traced to source
- Numbers Stations: Decades of broadcasts → eventually spy caught with radio

**One-time signals may never resolve:**
- Wow! Signal: One detection, no repeat, can't verify either way

**The more data, the better the constraints.**

## The ET Question

Across all three signal types:

| Case | ET Hypothesis Status |
|------|---------------------|
| Wow! Signal | Cannot eliminate |
| Fast Radio Bursts | Not supported (natural source found) |
| Numbers Stations | ❌ Eliminated (human origin proven) |

**Pattern:** When we get enough data, ET explanations tend to be eliminated by natural ones. The Wow! Signal survives only because we can't get more data.

**But:** Absence of confirmed ET signals doesn't mean ET doesn't exist. It means we haven't confirmed detection yet.

## Contrast with UAP

| Signals | UAP |
|---------|-----|
| Often resolve to natural/human source | Resist natural/human explanation |
| More data → clearer answers | More data → more anomalies |
| No multi-sensor confirmation | Multiple independent sensors |
| Passive detection | Active tracking + visual |

**Why the difference?**

Signal mysteries typically involve:
- Single detection modality (radio)
- Distance (billions of light years for FRBs)
- Limited information (just the signal characteristics)

UAP cases involve:
- Multiple detection modalities (radar + visual + IR)
- Close range (aircraft encounter distance)
- Behavioral information (maneuvering, response to intercept)

**More dimensions of evidence make UAP harder to explain away.**

---

## The Meta-Constraint

Across three signal mysteries:
- **1 resolved to known human activity** (Numbers Stations)
- **1 resolved to natural astrophysics** (FRBs)
- **1 remains genuinely uncertain** (Wow! Signal)

The signal domain tends toward resolution when data is available. The Wow! Signal remains open precisely because it's a single unrepeatable event.
