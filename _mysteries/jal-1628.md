---

November 17, 1986. Japan Air Lines Flight 1628, Boeing 747 cargo flight over Alaska. Captain Kenju Terauchi reported enormous object, described as "two times bigger than aircraft carrier." Radar confirmed. FAA investigated. Case remains unexplained.

**Credible witnesses, official investigation, radar confirmation.**

## THE MYSTERY

**Core Question:** What did JAL 1628 crew encounter over Alaska?

**Key Evidence:**
- Commercial 747 captain (experienced)
- Two other crew members witnessed
- FAA radar confirmation (partial)
- Military radar tracked
- Object described as massive
- FAA investigation file
- Captain's detailed drawings

---

## COMPETING HYPOTHESES

**H1: Lights from Ground/Clouds**
- Ice crystals reflecting lights
- Squid fishing boats below

**H2: Jupiter + Misidentification**
- Planet misidentified as object
- Radar false returns

**H3: Military Aircraft**
- Classified exercise near flight path
- Unusual formation

**H4: Unknown Technology**
- Object beyond known capability
- Massive size reported

## PREDICTIONS & TESTING

### H1: Ground Lights/Ice Crystals

**Predictions:**

1. **Stationary relative to ground** → ⚠️ **UNCLEAR**
   - Object appeared to follow aircraft
   - But crew movement could create illusion

2. **No radar confirmation** → ✗ **MAJOR FAIL**
   - FAA and military radar tracked
   - Ground lights don't appear on radar

3. **Crew familiar with phenomenon** → ✗ **MAJOR FAIL**
   - Experienced captain
   - Wouldn't file report over lights

**Score:** 0/3 with 1 unclear **= ~15%**

---

### H2: Jupiter Misidentification

**Predictions:**

1. **Consistent with Jupiter position** → ✓ **PASS**
   - Jupiter was visible that night
   - Direction matches some descriptions

2. **No radar confirmation** → ✗ **CRITICAL FAIL**
   - Jupiter doesn't show on radar
   - Radar confirmed object

3. **Stationary or slow** → ⚠️ **UNCLEAR**
   - Planetary motion slow
   - Object appeared to follow aircraft

**Score:** 1/3 with 1 unclear **= ~20%**

---

### H3: Military Aircraft

**Predictions:**

1. **FAA would identify** → ✗ **MAJOR FAIL**
   - FAA coordinated with military
   - Labeled "unknown"

2. **Normal aircraft size** → ✗ **CRITICAL FAIL**
   - Described as massive ("2x aircraft carrier")
   - No aircraft that large

3. **Explained after investigation** → ✗ **MAJOR FAIL**
   - Remains unexplained 37 years later

**Score:** 0/3 **= ~5%**

---

### H4: Unknown Technology

**Predictions:**

1. **Radar + visual confirmation** → ✓ **PASS**
   - Both FAA and military radar
   - Three crew members witnessed

2. **Experienced crew confused** → ✓ **PASS**
   - Captain couldn't identify
   - Filed official report

3. **Massive size described** → ⚠️ **UNCLEAR**
   - Consistent reporting from crew
   - Size estimates difficult at night
   - Could be perceptual error

4. **FAA unable to explain** → ✓ **PASS**
   - Investigation found no answer
   - Remains in unexplained category

5. **No conventional match** → ✓ **PASS**
   - Not weather, not known aircraft
   - No mundane explanation fits all factors

**Score:** 4/5 with 1 unclear **= 70%**

## COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

| Hypothesis | Overall Fit |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Unknown Technology** | **70%** |
| Jupiter | 20% |
| Ground Lights | 15% |
| Military Aircraft | 5% |

**Advantage Ratio:** 70% / 20% = **3.5:1** (rounds to **4:1**)

**Interpretation:** Unknown technology favored, but not overwhelming.

---

## CONSTRAINT STACKING

**CONSTRAINT 1: Radar Confirmation**
- FAA and military both tracked
- **Eliminates:** Pure misidentification, ground lights, Jupiter

**CONSTRAINT 2: Experienced Crew**
- Commercial airline captain
- Filed official report
- **Eliminates:** Casual error

**CONSTRAINT 3: FAA Investigation**
- Thorough investigation conducted
- No mundane explanation found
- **Supports:** Genuinely anomalous

**CONSTRAINT 4: Size Descriptions**
- "Twice aircraft carrier" claim
- Could be perceptual error
- **Weakens case** (subjective size estimation at night difficult)

**Constraints mostly converge, but size claim introduces uncertainty.**

---

## WHAT THIS CASE SHOWS

**Moderate strength case:**
- Good: Radar confirmation, experienced witnesses, FAA investigation
- Weak: Limited data release, size estimates subjective, some ambiguity

**Not as strong as Tic Tac or Tehran:**
- Tic Tac: Multiple sensors, clear physics data
- Tehran: Weapons interference, extreme performance
- JAL 1628: Good but less dramatic evidence

**Confidence:** Moderate (4:1 advantage solid but not overwhelming)

**What would strengthen:**
- Full radar data release
- Additional witness testimony
- Flight recorder data
