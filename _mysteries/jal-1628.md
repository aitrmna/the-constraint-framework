November 17, 1986. Japan Air Lines Flight 1628, Boeing 747 cargo over Alaska. Captain Kenju Terauchi reported enormous object ("two times bigger than aircraft carrier"). Radar confirmed. FAA investigated. Case remains unexplained.

**The test:** What must be true for each explanation? Does reality match?

---

## Competing Hypotheses

1. Ground lights/ice crystals
2. Jupiter misidentification
3. Military aircraft
4. Unknown technology

---

## H1: Ground Lights/Ice Crystals

**What must be true:**
- Stationary relative to ground
- No radar confirmation
- Experienced crew wouldn't file report

**Reality check:**

**Stationary?** → ⚠️ UNCLEAR
- Object appeared to follow aircraft
- Crew movement could create illusion

**No radar?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- FAA and military radar both tracked
- Ground lights don't appear on radar

**Crew wouldn't report?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- Experienced captain filed official report
- Wouldn't risk reputation over lights

**Score:** 0/3 passes, 1 unclear, 2 major fails
Calculation: 0% × (1 - 0.2) = **0%**

Adjusted: **~15%** (unclear allows some possibility)

---

## H2: Jupiter Misidentification

**What must be true:**
- Position consistent with Jupiter
- No radar confirmation
- Stationary or very slow movement

**Reality check:**

**Jupiter position?** → ✓ PASS
- Jupiter was visible that night
- Direction matches some descriptions

**No radar?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Jupiter doesn't show on radar
- Radar confirmed object
- This kills the hypothesis

**Stationary?** → ⚠️ UNCLEAR
- Planetary motion slow
- Object appeared to follow

**Score:** 1/3 passes, 1 critical fail, 1 unclear
Calculation: 33% × (1 - 0.6) = **13%**

Adjusted: **~20%**

**Result:** Critical failure on radar. Dead.

---

## H3: Military Aircraft

**What must be true:**
- FAA would identify after coordination
- Normal aircraft size
- Would be explained after investigation

**Reality check:**

**FAA would identify?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- FAA coordinated with military
- Labeled "unknown"

**Normal size?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Described as massive ("2× aircraft carrier")
- No aircraft that large exists

**Would explain?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- Remains unexplained 37 years later

**Score:** 0/3 passes, 1 critical + 2 major fails
Calculation: 0% × (1 - 0.6) = **0%**

Adjusted: **~5%**

**Result:** Dead. No aircraft is that large.

---

## H4: Unknown Technology

**What must be true:**
- Radar + visual confirmation
- Experienced crew unable to identify
- Massive size described
- FAA unable to explain
- No conventional match

**Reality check:**

**Radar + visual?** → ✓ PASS
- Both FAA and military radar
- Three crew members witnessed

**Crew confused?** → ✓ PASS
- Captain couldn't identify
- Filed official report

**Massive size?** → ⚠️ UNCLEAR
- Consistent crew reporting
- Size estimates difficult at night
- Could be perceptual error

**FAA unable to explain?** → ✓ PASS
- Investigation found no answer
- Remains unexplained

**No conventional match?** → ✓ PASS
- Not weather, not known aircraft
- No mundane explanation fits all data

**Score:** 4/5 passes, 1 unclear
Calculation: 80% × (1 - 0) = **80%**

Adjusted for size uncertainty: **~70%**

---

## Comparison

| Hypothesis | Score | Critical Failures |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| **Unknown technology** | **70%** | **0** |
| Jupiter | 20% | 1 |
| Ground lights | 15% | 0 |
| Military aircraft | 5% | 1 |

**Advantage:** 70% / 20% = **3.5:1** (rounds to 4:1)

---

## What This Means

**Moderate-strength case:**

**Good evidence:**
- Radar confirmation (FAA + military)
- Experienced commercial captain
- Official FAA investigation found no answer

**Weak evidence:**
- Size estimates subjective (could be perceptual error)
- Limited data release (full details not public)

**Not as strong as Tic Tac or Tehran:**
- Tic Tac: Multiple sensors, clear physics data, 15:1
- Tehran: Weapons interference, extreme performance, 8:1
- JAL 1628: Good evidence but less dramatic, 4:1

**Confidence:** Moderate

Unknown technology survives, but with less certainty than strongest cases.
