November 17, 1986. Japan Airlines Flight 1628, a Boeing 747 cargo jet, was flying over Alaska en route from Paris to Tokyo. Captain Kenju Terauchi, a veteran pilot with 29 years experience, reported an encounter lasting over 50 minutes with multiple objects — including one he described as the size of "two aircraft carriers."

The FAA investigated. Radar data existed. Then things got strange.

## CONSTRAINT STACKING ANALYSIS

**CLAIM:** What did JAL 1628 encounter over Alaska?

**STARTING SOLUTION SPACE:**
- Misidentified stars/planets (Jupiter and Mars were visible)
- Military aircraft
- Atmospheric phenomenon / ice crystals
- Radar malfunction + pilot error
- Hoax
- Non-human technology

---

### CONSTRAINT 1 (MOST DAMNING): FAA Radar Confirmation

**Evidence:**
- FAA Anchorage Center tracked the 747
- Controller saw second radar return near the aircraft
- Military radar also showed "something" in vicinity
- FAA's John Callahan (Division Chief) later confirmed radar data showed object
- Callahan claimed CIA and others took all data in secret meeting, told participants "this meeting never happened"

**What this means:** Ground radar confirmed something was there. This wasn't just pilot perception.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Pure optical illusion (radar return present)
- ❌ Stars/planets (Jupiter doesn't appear on radar)
- ❌ Ice crystals (don't generate radar returns like this)

**Remaining:** Physical object near aircraft

---

### CONSTRAINT 2: Duration — 50+ Minutes

**Evidence:**
- Encounter began over northeastern Alaska
- Continued for approximately 400 miles
- Objects appeared, disappeared, reappeared
- Duration approximately 50 minutes
- Multiple phases: initial lights, then massive object, then objects departed

**What this means:** Not a fleeting glimpse. Extended observation by experienced crew with time to assess.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Brief misidentification (50 minutes of observation)
- ❌ Single optical artifact (multiple phases, movements)

**Remaining:** Persistent phenomenon accompanying aircraft across Alaska

---

### CONSTRAINT 3: Crew Description — Three Witnesses

**Evidence:**
- Captain Terauchi: Detailed descriptions, drew sketches, described massive craft with lights
- Co-pilot Tamefuji: Confirmed seeing lights
- Flight engineer Tsukuba: Confirmed seeing lights
- All three independently reported to FAA

**What this means:** Not single-witness. Entire flight crew observed.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Single pilot hallucination (three crew members)

**Remaining:** Something visible to multiple trained observers

---

### CONSTRAINT 4: The Size Description

**Evidence:**
- Captain Terauchi described the main object as "two aircraft carriers" in size
- Object was silhouetted against dim Alaskan sky
- Pale outline visible around lights
- Object maintained position relative to 747 for extended period

**Skeptic claim:** Terauchi was unreliable, prone to exaggeration

**Response:** 
- His size estimate might be off
- But the FAA investigated seriously
- Radar showed something
- His co-pilot and engineer saw lights too
- FAA didn't dismiss him as unreliable during investigation

**PARTIALLY CONSTRAINS:**
- ⚠️ Exact size uncertain
- ⚠️ Something large was perceived

**Remaining:** Object of substantial apparent size

---

### CONSTRAINT 5: Object Maneuvering

**Evidence:**
- Initial two smaller objects approached from below
- Showed "flames" or bright exhaust
- Objects moved erratically, then stationed themselves in front of 747
- Later, massive object appeared
- When another aircraft was vectored to investigate, objects disappeared
- Objects reappeared after other aircraft left

**What this means:** Objects demonstrated awareness of the situation — departed when interceptor approached, returned when it left.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Passive phenomenon (responded to intercept attempt)
- ❌ Dumb object (apparent situational awareness)

**Remaining:** Controlled objects with apparent intelligence

---

### CONSTRAINT 6: Official Response

**Evidence:**
- FAA conducted formal investigation
- Initially treated seriously
- Then FAA public affairs tried to dismiss as Jupiter/Mars
- But FAA Division Chief Callahan later revealed:
  - Real radar data existed
  - Secret meeting with CIA, FBI, Reagan's scientific staff
  - All data confiscated
  - Participants told to keep quiet
  - Callahan kept copies

**What this means:** Official dismissal contradicted by insider testimony. Someone took this very seriously despite public downplaying.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Easy explanation (would have been released, not confiscated)
- ❌ Non-event (CIA doesn't attend meetings about Jupiter sightings)

**Remaining:** Something significant enough to classify

---

### CONSTRAINT 7: Pilot's Career

**Evidence:**
- Captain Terauchi was initially grounded after speaking publicly
- Later reinstated
- Never retracted account
- Remained employed by JAL until retirement
- Maintained story until death

**What this means:** Speaking cost him professionally. He had incentive to recant. Never did.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Hoax for attention (attention hurt his career)

---

## ANOMALIES

**"Why so large?"**
→ Unknown. If Terauchi's perception was accurate, this is among the largest objects ever reported. Might have been closer than he thought, appearing larger. Or might have been enormous.

**"Why follow a cargo plane?"**
→ Unknown. Possibly interest in aircraft itself. Possibly coincidental flight path. Route was over remote Alaska — limited witnesses.

**"Why did CIA get involved?"**
→ Unknown officially. Callahan's claim: national security interest. Radar data over sovereign airspace showing unknowns is inherently a security matter.

All anomalies fit within remaining solution space.

## RESULT

| Hypothesis | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Stars/planets (Jupiter, Mars) | ❌ Eliminated |
| Military aircraft | ❌ Eliminated |
| Ice crystals / atmosphere | ❌ Eliminated |
| Radar malfunction + pilot error | ❌ Eliminated |
| Hoax | ❌ Eliminated |
| **Non-human technology** | **Cannot eliminate** |

## What This Means

We are not saying "JAL 1628 was followed by a massive alien spacecraft."

We are saying: "A veteran crew observed objects for 50+ minutes. FAA radar confirmed something present. The encounter was significant enough for CIA involvement and data confiscation according to the FAA Division Chief who was there. The official Jupiter/Mars explanation doesn't survive basic scrutiny — planets don't appear on radar, don't maneuver, and don't warrant classified meetings. Non-human technology cannot be eliminated."

Callahan kept the data. The radar tapes exist somewhere. The truth is documented — just not released.
