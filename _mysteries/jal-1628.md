November 17, 1986. Japan Airlines Flight 1628, a Boeing 747 cargo jet, was flying over Alaska en route from Paris to Tokyo. Captain Kenju Terauchi, a veteran pilot with 29 years experience, reported an encounter lasting over 50 minutes with multiple objects — including one he described as the size of "two aircraft carriers."

The FAA investigated. Radar data existed. Then things got strange.

## EVIDENCE CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS

This case demonstrates **MODERATE convergence** — compelling witness testimony + radar but data confiscation reduces score.

### Axioms Applied

**✓ Boundary Conservation (STRONG)**
- Controlled airspace over Alaska
- FAA radar coverage = clear boundary
- Flight path documented and trackable
- Verdict: Strong spatial boundaries

**✓ Irreversibility (STRONG)**
- FAA investigation reports (permanent)
- Pilot statements and sketches (permanent)
- Radar recordings existed (later confiscated but confirmed)
- 50-minute duration documented
- Verdict: Strong but partially suppressed evidence

**⚠️ Convergence Supremacy (MODERATE)**
- Three crew members (pilot, co-pilot, flight engineer)
- BUT: All on same aircraft (not fully independent)
- Ground radar confirmation (independent sensor)
- BUT: Radar data confiscated (per Callahan testimony)
- Verdict: Some independence, evidence suppression reduces score

**✓ Gradient Navigation (STRONG)**
- 50-minute encounter = extended gradient
- Multiple phases (small objects → massive object → departure)
- 400-mile flight path with persistent phenomenon
- Verdict: Strong temporal gradient

**✓ Bottleneck Traceability (STRONG)**
- All observations must pass through: (1) Crew reports, (2) FAA investigation, (3) Radar confirmation
- Objects appeared at all three checkpoints
- Data confiscation at bottleneck suggests high significance
- Verdict: Clear bottleneck tracing, deliberate suppression

**⚠️ State-Change Amplification (MODERATE)**
- No extreme accelerations documented
- Objects maintained position relative to 747 (sustained not dramatic)
- Appearance/disappearance when interceptor approached = behavioral change
- Verdict: Behavioral anomalies but not high-energy events

### Evidence Nodes (scored 0-10)

1. **FAA radar confirmation** — 8/10
   - John Callahan (FAA Division Chief) confirmed radar data
   - Ground radar + aircraft radar
   - Later confiscated by CIA (per Callahan)
   - Confiscation itself is evidence of significance

2. **50-minute duration** — 8/10
   - Extended observation period
   - 400 miles of flight path
   - Multiple phases documented
   - Rules out brief misidentification

3. **Three crew witnesses** — 6/10
   - Pilot, co-pilot, flight engineer all reported
   - But: On same aircraft, not independent platforms
   - Captain Terauchi most detailed, others confirmed lights

4. **Size description ("two aircraft carriers")** — 4/10
   - May be exaggerated or misperceived
   - Silhouette against sky hard to judge
   - Other witnesses saw lights not massive object
   - Reduced reliability for extreme claims

5. **CIA/agency meeting and data confiscation** — 8/10
   - Callahan testimony about secret meeting
   - All data confiscated, participants told to be quiet
   - Suggests significance beyond mundane explanation
   - Callahan kept copies (claimed)

6. **Object response to interceptor** — 7/10
   - Disappeared when other aircraft vectored in
   - Reappeared after it left
   - Suggests awareness/intelligence
   - Behavioral not just passive phenomenon

7. **Pilot career impact** — 6/10
   - Terauchi initially grounded for speaking publicly
   - Later reinstated
   - Never retracted despite professional cost
   - Suggests genuine belief, not hoax

### Independence Check

- Crew ↔ Ground radar: Different observation methods ✓
- Visual ↔ Radar: Different detection types ✓
- BUT: All crew on same aircraft ✗
- Callahan testimony ↔ Original reports: Years apart, independent verification ✓

### Convergence Score

**7 nodes × 6.7 average = 47/100**

**Confidence bracket:** Moderate (40-59 range)

**Interpretation:** Solid case but handicapped by:
- Single-platform witnesses (all crew on one aircraft)
- Extreme size claim reduces reliability
- Critical radar evidence confiscated

**Strengthened by:**
- 50-minute duration
- Radar confirmation
- Data confiscation suggests genuine significance
- Pilot never retracted despite cost

### Critical Insight: Data Suppression as Signal

**The confiscation itself is evidence.**

If FAA/CIA confiscated radar data and held secret meeting:
- Mundane explanation (Jupiter) doesn't require this
- Classified aircraft could be acknowledged to FAA internally
- Suppression suggests something genuinely unknown and significant

**Bottleneck test:** The confiscation is at a key bottleneck. Data existed, was verified, then suppressed. This pattern is consistent with "don't know what it is, can't explain it, classify it."

### Comparison

| Case | Score | Key Feature |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Tic Tac | 60/100 | Multi-sensor, extreme calculated performance |
| Gimbal/GoFast | 48/100 | Sustained pattern, limited release |
| **JAL 1628** | **47/100** | **Long duration, radar + suppression** |

**47/100 = Moderate confidence** something anomalous occurred, but extreme claims (size) and evidence suppression prevent higher score.

## CONSTRAINT STACKING ANALYSIS

**CLAIM:** What did JAL 1628 encounter over Alaska?

**STARTING SOLUTION SPACE:**
- Misidentified stars/planets (Jupiter and Mars were visible)
- Military aircraft
- Atmospheric phenomenon / ice crystals
- Radar malfunction + pilot error
- Hoax
- Non-human technology

---

### CONSTRAINT 1 (MOST DAMNING): FAA Radar Confirmation

**Evidence:**
- FAA Anchorage Center tracked the 747
- Controller saw second radar return near the aircraft
- Military radar also showed "something" in vicinity
- FAA's John Callahan (Division Chief) later confirmed radar data showed object
- Callahan claimed CIA and others took all data in secret meeting, told participants "this meeting never happened"

**What this means:** Ground radar confirmed something was there. This wasn't just pilot perception.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Pure optical illusion (radar return present)
- ❌ Stars/planets (Jupiter doesn't appear on radar)
- ❌ Ice crystals (don't generate radar returns like this)

**Remaining:** Physical object near aircraft

---

### CONSTRAINT 2: Duration — 50+ Minutes

**Evidence:**
- Encounter began over northeastern Alaska
- Continued for approximately 400 miles
- Objects appeared, disappeared, reappeared
- Duration approximately 50 minutes
- Multiple phases: initial lights, then massive object, then objects departed

**What this means:** Not a fleeting glimpse. Extended observation by experienced crew with time to assess.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Brief misidentification (50 minutes of observation)
- ❌ Single optical artifact (multiple phases, movements)

**Remaining:** Persistent phenomenon accompanying aircraft across Alaska

---

### CONSTRAINT 3: Crew Description — Three Witnesses

**Evidence:**
- Captain Terauchi: Detailed descriptions, drew sketches, described massive craft with lights
- Co-pilot Tamefuji: Confirmed seeing lights
- Flight engineer Tsukuba: Confirmed seeing lights
- All three independently reported to FAA

**What this means:** Not single-witness. Entire flight crew observed.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Single pilot hallucination (three crew members)

**Remaining:** Something visible to multiple trained observers

---

### CONSTRAINT 4: The Size Description

**Evidence:**
- Captain Terauchi described the main object as "two aircraft carriers" in size
- Object was silhouetted against dim Alaskan sky
- Pale outline visible around lights
- Object maintained position relative to 747 for extended period

**Skeptic claim:** Terauchi was unreliable, prone to exaggeration

**Response:** 
- His size estimate might be off
- But the FAA investigated seriously
- Radar showed something
- His co-pilot and engineer saw lights too
- FAA didn't dismiss him as unreliable during investigation

**PARTIALLY CONSTRAINS:**
- ⚠️ Exact size uncertain
- ⚠️ Something large was perceived

**Remaining:** Object of substantial apparent size

---

### CONSTRAINT 5: Object Maneuvering

**Evidence:**
- Initial two smaller objects approached from below
- Showed "flames" or bright exhaust
- Objects moved erratically, then stationed themselves in front of 747
- Later, massive object appeared
- When another aircraft was vectored to investigate, objects disappeared
- Objects reappeared after other aircraft left

**What this means:** Objects demonstrated awareness of the situation — departed when interceptor approached, returned when it left.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Passive phenomenon (responded to intercept attempt)
- ❌ Dumb object (apparent situational awareness)

**Remaining:** Controlled objects with apparent intelligence

---

### CONSTRAINT 6: Official Response

**Evidence:**
- FAA conducted formal investigation
- Initially treated seriously
- Then FAA public affairs tried to dismiss as Jupiter/Mars
- But FAA Division Chief Callahan later revealed:
  - Real radar data existed
  - Secret meeting with CIA, FBI, Reagan's scientific staff
  - All data confiscated
  - Participants told to keep quiet
  - Callahan kept copies

**What this means:** Official dismissal contradicted by insider testimony. Someone took this very seriously despite public downplaying.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Easy explanation (would have been released, not confiscated)
- ❌ Non-event (CIA doesn't attend meetings about Jupiter sightings)

**Remaining:** Something significant enough to classify

---

### CONSTRAINT 7: Pilot's Career

**Evidence:**
- Captain Terauchi was initially grounded after speaking publicly
- Later reinstated
- Never retracted account
- Remained employed by JAL until retirement
- Maintained story until death

**What this means:** Speaking cost him professionally. He had incentive to recant. Never did.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Hoax for attention (attention hurt his career)

---

## ANOMALIES

**"Why so large?"**
→ Unknown. If Terauchi's perception was accurate, this is among the largest objects ever reported. Might have been closer than he thought, appearing larger. Or might have been enormous.

**"Why follow a cargo plane?"**
→ Unknown. Possibly interest in aircraft itself. Possibly coincidental flight path. Route was over remote Alaska — limited witnesses.

**"Why did CIA get involved?"**
→ Unknown officially. Callahan's claim: national security interest. Radar data over sovereign airspace showing unknowns is inherently a security matter.

All anomalies fit within remaining solution space.

## RESULT

| Hypothesis | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Stars/planets (Jupiter, Mars) | ❌ Eliminated |
| Military aircraft | ❌ Eliminated |
| Ice crystals / atmosphere | ❌ Eliminated |
| Radar malfunction + pilot error | ❌ Eliminated |
| Hoax | ❌ Eliminated |
| **Non-human technology** | **Cannot eliminate** |

## What This Means

We are not saying "JAL 1628 was followed by a massive alien spacecraft."

We are saying: "A veteran crew observed objects for 50+ minutes. FAA radar confirmed something present. The encounter was significant enough for CIA involvement and data confiscation according to the FAA Division Chief who was there. The official Jupiter/Mars explanation doesn't survive basic scrutiny — planets don't appear on radar, don't maneuver, and don't warrant classified meetings. Non-human technology cannot be eliminated."

Callahan kept the data. The radar tapes exist somewhere. The truth is documented — just not released.
