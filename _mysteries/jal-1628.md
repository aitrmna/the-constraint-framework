description: Commercial 747, Jupiter/Mars misidentification, FAA debunked
result: Jupiter/Mars misidentification - FAA conclusion (misidentification 95% vs unknown 5%)
category: uap
---

**November 17, 1986.** Japan Air Lines Flight 1628, Boeing 747 cargo over Alaska.

Captain Kenju Terauchi reported enormous object ("two times bigger than aircraft carrier"). Claims of radar confirmation. FAA investigated for 3 months.

**Then you check the FAA investigation.**

**FAA conclusion:** Captain misidentified Jupiter and Mars. Radar data showed "split image" artifact. Captain was "UFO repeater" with pattern of sightings.

**The test:** What must be true for each explanation? Does reality match?

## Verified Official Evidence

**Timeline:**
- **Nov 17, 1986, 5:11 PM:** Captain reports objects to left of aircraft
- **5:19 PM:** Contacts Anchorage control
- **5:45 PM:** Requests course change
- **5:51 PM:** United flight and C-130 see only JAL 1628 - nothing else
- **6:20 PM:** JAL lands safely in Anchorage

**Official Investigation:**
- **FAA 3-month investigation** (concluded March 1987)
- **FAA characterization:** Captain Terauchi is "UFO repeater"
- **Terauchi's UFO history:**
  - Reported 2 other UFOs before Nov 17, 1986
  - Reported 2 more UFOs in January 1987 (same area)
  - Pattern of seeing UFOs where others see nothing
- **Jan 11, 1987 sighting:** Terauchi reported "irregular pulsating lights" + "large black chunk"
  - FAA radar saw nothing
  - Determined to be "lights from small villages diffused by thin clouds"

**FAA Final Conclusion (March 5, 1987):**
- Objects were **Jupiter and Mars**
- Radar data was "split image" artifact (ghost return)
- "Unable to support what they saw"
- No other aircraft in area

**Named Witnesses:**
- Captain Kenju Terauchi (pilot, UFO repeater)
- First Officer Takanori Tamefuji (co-pilot)
- Flight Engineer Yoshio Tsukuba

**Radar Data:**
- Anchorage FAA: intermittent blip (later identified as split image)
- US Air Force (Elmendorf): brief contact (determined to be clutter)
- United Airlines flight: saw nothing on radar
- C-130 military cargo: saw nothing on radar
- JAL 1628's own radar: briefly showed something

**Other Aircraft Observations:**
- **United Airlines flight diverted to look:** saw nothing
- **Air Force C-130 diverted to look:** saw nothing
- Only JAL 1628 reported seeing anything

## Competing Hypotheses

1. Jupiter/Mars misidentification (FAA conclusion)
2. Unknown technology

---

## H1: Jupiter/Mars Misidentification

**What must be true:**
- Jupiter and Mars visible that night
- Atmospheric effects can enhance brightness
- Pattern fits captain's UFO reporting history
- Other aircraft/radar see nothing
- FAA radar artifact explainable
- Captain known for UFO sightings

**Reality check:**

**Planets visible?** → ✓ PASS
- **Jupiter and Mars both visible and bright**
- Correct positions for reported sightings
- FAA astronomers confirmed
- Atmospheric conditions can create illusions

**Atmospheric effects?** → ✓ PASS
- Ice crystals in atmosphere can create halos
- Bright planets distorted by atmospheric conditions
- Creates impression of shape/structure
- "Lights from villages diffused by thin clouds" (FAA on Jan 1987 sighting)

**Pattern fits history?** → ✓ PASS
- **Captain Terauchi = "UFO repeater"**
- 2 prior UFO reports before Nov 17
- 2 more UFO reports in Jan 1987
- January sighting: lights were villages through ice crystals
- **Pattern: captain sees UFOs where others see nothing**

**Other aircraft see nothing?** → ✓ PASS
- **United Airlines:** diverted to look, saw nothing visual or radar
- **Air Force C-130:** diverted to look, saw nothing visual or radar
- Only JAL 1628 reported seeing anything
- If real object: others would see it

**Radar artifact explainable?** → ✓ PASS
- **"Split image" or "ghost return"**
- Radar receiver picks up signal at wrong time in cycle
- Creates false echo in different position
- Common radar artifact
- Explains brief, intermittent blip

**Captain's credibility?** → ✓ PASS
- **Pattern of UFO sightings**
- FAA characterized as "UFO repeater"
- Jan 1987 sighting debunked (village lights)
- **Grounded by JAL for talking to press about UFOs**
- Reinstated only years later
- Pattern suggests perceptual bias

**Score:** 6/6 passes, 0 fails
Calculation: 100% × (1 - 0) = **100%**

Adjusted for any uncertainty: **~95%**

## H2: Unknown Technology

**What must be true:**
- Real physical object (not planets)
- Multiple independent confirmations
- Radar data confirms solid object
- Other aircraft would see it
- Pattern inconsistent with captain's history
- FAA investigation would find evidence

**Reality check:**

**Real object?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- **Jupiter and Mars account for all observations**
- FAA investigation concluded misidentification
- Astronomers confirmed planet positions
- No evidence beyond captain's perception

**Independent confirmation?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- **United flight saw NOTHING**
- **C-130 saw NOTHING**
- Only JAL 1628 reported anything
- No independent visual confirmation
- Contrast with Tic Tac (5 sensors, multiple aircraft)

**Radar solid object?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- **"Split image" artifact (FAA conclusion)**
- Ghost return, not real object
- Intermittent, not continuous
- Disappeared upon analysis
- Other radars saw nothing consistent

**Others would see?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- If "twice size of aircraft carrier" was real
- United and C-130 would definitely see it
- They saw nothing
- **Massive object invisible to all but one crew = implausible**

**Inconsistent with history?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- **Captain had pattern of UFO reports**
- Jan 1987: saw "black chunk" - was village lights
- "UFO repeater" designation appropriate
- Pattern: sees UFOs where investigation shows mundane causes

**FAA would find evidence?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- **FAA 3-month investigation**
- Astronomers, radar analysts, investigators
- Concluded: Jupiter/Mars + radar artifact
- No evidence supporting unknown object
- Professional investigation = no mystery

**Score:** 0/6 passes, 6 critical fails
Calculation: 0% × (1 - 0.6) = **0%**

Generous adjustment: **~5%** (possibility FAA wrong)

## Comparison

| Hypothesis | Score | Critical Failures | Key Evidence |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Jupiter/Mars** | **95%** | **0** | FAA conclusion, planets visible, UFO repeater, others saw nothing |
| Unknown technology | 5% | 6 | No independent confirmation, radar artifact, pattern of false reports |

**Advantage:** 95% / 5% = **19:1** for misidentification

**Result:** FAA investigation conclusive. Misidentification.

## The Critical Pattern: UFO Repeater

**Terauchi's sighting history:**

**Before Nov 17, 1986:**
- 2 prior UFO reports

**Nov 17, 1986:**
- JAL 1628 incident
- Reports "mothership twice size of aircraft carrier"
- No one else sees it

**After Nov 17, 1986:**
- Jan 1987: Reports "irregular pulsating lights" + "large black chunk"
- **FAA investigation:** lights from villages through ice crystals
- Reports object "did not want to be seen"
- Claims "we humans will meet them in near future"

**Pattern:** Captain sees UFOs. Investigation shows mundane causes. Others see nothing.

**FAA designation:** "UFO repeater" - accurate characterization.

## Comparison to Strong Cases

| Factor | Tic Tac (26:1) | Tehran (8:1) | JAL 1628 (19:1 against) |
|--------|----------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Independent witnesses** | Multiple aircraft | Two F-4s | NONE |
| **Radar confirmation** | 5 sensors | Ground + F-4 | Artifact/ghost return |
| **Physics violations** | 5,880 Gs | 60K ft drop | None |
| **Other aircraft see it** | Yes | Yes | NO |
| **Professional investigation** | Pentagon verified | DIA report | FAA debunked |
| **Witness pattern** | Normal | Normal | UFO repeater |

**JAL 1628 is the inverse of Tic Tac:**
- Tic Tac: Multiple confirmations → 78% unknown
- JAL 1628: Zero confirmations → 5% unknown

---

## What the FAA Found

**Official FAA conclusion (March 1987):**
- Jupiter and Mars misidentified
- Radar "split image" artifact
- Captain is "UFO repeater"
- No other aircraft confirmed
- No evidence of unknown object

**Supporting evidence:**
- Astronomers confirmed planet positions
- Radar analysts explained artifact
- Jan 1987 sighting debunked (village lights)
- Pattern of misidentification

**Result:** Case closed. Misidentification.

---

## The Aftermath

**Captain Terauchi:**
- Grounded by JAL for talking to press
- Reassigned to desk duty
- Reinstated years later
- Retired believing it was real
- Continued UFO advocacy

**Why grounded?**
- Airline liability concerns
- Pattern of UFO reports
- Media attention problematic
- Not punishment for reporting - punishment for publicity

---

## The Lesson

**The framework eliminates weak cases correctly:**

**Not every pilot report = strong case**

What matters:
1. **Independent confirmation** (JAL 1628: 0, Tic Tac: multiple)
2. **Investigative conclusion** (JAL 1628: debunked, Tehran: unsolved)
3. **Witness pattern** (JAL 1628: repeater, Tic Tac: normal)
4. **Other aircraft confirmation** (JAL 1628: saw nothing, Tic Tac: saw object)

**JAL 1628: Professional FAA investigation → Jupiter/Mars**
**Tic Tac: Pentagon investigation → cannot explain**

---

**Assessment confidence:** Very high (95% vs 5% = 19:1)

**Status:** Misidentification confirmed by FAA investigation

**Quality:** Weak case - professional investigation debunked it, witness is UFO repeater

**Conclusion:** FAA investigation conclusive. Jupiter and Mars misidentified by captain with pattern of UFO reports. No independent confirmation. Radar artifact explained. Case properly debunked.
