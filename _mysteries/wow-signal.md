category: signals

August 15, 1977. Big Ear telescope, Ohio. Astronomer Jerry Ehman saw data printout showing anomalous signal. Circled it. Wrote "Wow!"

Signal matched exactly what we'd expect from ET transmission. Never explained. Never repeated.

**The test:** What must be true for each explanation? Does reality match?

---

## Competing Hypotheses

1. Terrestrial interference
2. Equipment malfunction
3. Satellite reflection
4. Natural source (comet or unknown)
5. Extraterrestrial signal

---

## H1: Terrestrial Interference

**What must be true:**
- Signal from Earth-based transmitter
- Random frequency
- Wouldn't match sidereal (star-fixed) timing

**Reality check:**

**Earth transmitter?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Signal at 1420.405 MHz (hydrogen line)
- International agreements protect this frequency
- Illegal to transmit here
- Not random - most logical frequency for interstellar communication

**Random frequency?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Exactly on hydrogen line (21cm wavelength)
- Most abundant element in universe
- "Naturally quiet" band
- Any technical civilization would know it

**Sidereal timing?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- 72-second duration exactly matches telescope sweep for fixed cosmic source
- Rise-fall pattern matched antenna beam pattern perfectly
- Source was where telescope was pointing in space

**Score:** 0/3 passes, 3 critical fails
**Result:** Dead. Not terrestrial.

---

## H2: Equipment Malfunction

**What must be true:**
- Random noise pattern
- Wouldn't match beam pattern
- Wouldn't land on precise frequency

**Reality check:**

**Random pattern?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Perfect match to antenna beam pattern
- Rise-fall exactly as expected for point source
- Too perfect for random malfunction

**Frequency random?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Exactly on hydrogen line
- Equipment noise wouldn't target this precisely

**Score:** 0/2 passes, 2 critical fails
**Result:** Dead. Not malfunction.

---

## H3: Satellite Reflection

**What must be true:**
- Satellite at right position at right time
- Would show Doppler shift
- Might repeat on orbital period

**Reality check:**

**Satellite position?** → ⚠️ UNCLEAR
- No known satellite at that position confirmed
- Possible unknown satellite

**Doppler shift?** → ⚠️ UNCLEAR
- Signal narrowband (<10 kHz)
- Satellite would show frequency shift
- Data insufficient to rule out

**Repeat on orbit?** → ✗ FAIL
- Never repeated
- Satellite would pass through same position regularly

**Score:** 0/3 passes, 1 fail, 2 unclear
**Result:** Weak. Cannot eliminate but problems exist.

---

## H4: Natural Source

**What must be true:**
- Narrowband natural emission possible
- Located in right position (Sagittarius)
- One-time or intermittent event
- Comet or other known source

**Reality check:**

**Narrowband possible?** → ⚠️ UNCLEAR
- Natural sources typically broadband
- But hydrogen line emission exists naturally
- Narrowband natural signal rare but possible

**Right location?** → ✓ PASS
- Sagittarius constellation
- No known obvious source at exact position

**One-time event?** → ✓ PASS
- Natural transients exist
- Wouldn't necessarily repeat

**Comet hypothesis (266P/Christensen)?** → ⚠️ UNCLEAR
- 2017 proposal: Comet emitting at hydrogen frequency
- Orbital calculations disputed
- No comet ever observed producing such strong narrowband signal
- Contested but not eliminated

**Score:** 2/4 passes, 2 unclear
**Result:** Viable but uncertain.

---

## H5: Extraterrestrial Signal

**What must be true:**
- Narrowband transmission
- Hydrogen line frequency (intelligent choice)
- Directed toward Earth (explains no repeat)
- From cosmic source
- Strong intensity

**Reality check:**

**Narrowband?** → ✓ PASS
- Less than 10 kHz bandwidth
- Consistent with engineered signal

**Hydrogen frequency?** → ✓ PASS
- 1420.405 MHz exactly
- Most logical choice for interstellar communication
- Universal constant

**Directed explains no repeat?** → ✓ PASS
- One-time directed transmission wouldn't repeat
- Not a beacon (those repeat)
- Scanning transmission that swept past Earth

**Cosmic source?** → ✓ PASS
- Sidereal timing
- Beam pattern match
- From space, not Earth

**Strong intensity?** → ✓ PASS
- 30× background noise
- Clear signal

**But also:**
- Never repeated despite 100+ follow-up observations → ⚠️
- Multiple telescopes searched for decades → ⚠️
- If beacon, would repeat → ⚠️

**Score:** 5/5 on characteristics, but non-repetition weakens
**Result:** Viable but uncertain. Could be directed non-beacon transmission.

## Comparison

| Hypothesis | Score | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Terrestrial | 0% | Dead (critical fails) |
| Malfunction | 0% | Dead (critical fails) |
| Satellite | ~30% | Weak (no repeat) |
| **Natural source** | **~40%** | **Viable** (comet disputed) |
| **ET signal** | **~45%** | **Viable** (directed, not beacon) |

**Result:** Too close to call. Natural vs ET both survive.

## Why This Case Doesn't Resolve

**What we know:**
- Not terrestrial (frequency + sidereal timing kill it)
- Not malfunction (pattern too perfect)
- Genuine cosmic source
- Narrowband at hydrogen line

**What we don't know:**
- Why never repeated
- Exact source location (no follow-up detection)
- Comet hypothesis contested
- If ET, why one transmission?

**The constraints narrow but don't eliminate.**

---

## What This Means

**Unlike most mysteries, Wow! Signal constraints leave multiple viable options.**

Natural source and ET both survive. Evidence insufficient to choose.

**This is honest assessment:** When you can't eliminate down to one, you say so.

**The method tells you:**
- What you know (not terrestrial, not malfunction)
- What you don't know (which viable hypothesis is correct)

---

**Confidence:** Low (multiple hypotheses viable)
**Status:** Unresolved - insufficient data
**Leading candidates:** Natural source (possibly comet) ~40%, ET signal ~45%
**What would resolve:** Repeat detection or source identification
