description: Big Ear telescope, 1977. Constraint stacking analysis of the most famous SETI detection.
result: Genuinely uncertain — P(ET) ≈ 40%, P(natural) ≈ 50%

August 15, 1977. Big Ear radio telescope, Ohio. Astronomer Jerry Ehman saw a data printout showing an anomalous signal. He circled it and wrote "Wow!"

The signal matched exactly what we'd expect from an extraterrestrial transmission. It's never been explained. It's never repeated.

What survives constraint stacking?

## CONSTRAINT STACKING ANALYSIS

**CLAIM:** What was the Wow! Signal?

**STARTING SOLUTION SPACE:**
- Terrestrial interference (Earth-based radio)
- Satellite reflection
- Equipment malfunction
- Natural astronomical source (comet, quasar, etc.)
- Extraterrestrial intelligence
- Unknown natural phenomenon

---

### CONSTRAINT 1 (MOST DAMNING): The Frequency — 1420.405 MHz

**Evidence:**
- Signal was at hydrogen line frequency (21cm wavelength)
- This is the most logical frequency for interstellar communication:
  - Most abundant element in universe
  - Naturally "quiet" band
  - Any technical civilization would know it
- International agreements protect this frequency from terrestrial transmission

**What this means:** Either deliberate choice of "universal" frequency, or coincidental natural emission at hydrogen line.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Random terrestrial interference (protected frequency, would be illegal/unusual)
- ❌ Random equipment noise (wouldn't land exactly on hydrogen line)

**Solution space remaining:** Deliberate terrestrial transmission, satellite, natural astronomical source, ET, unknown phenomenon

**DAMNING POWER: HIGH**

---

### CONSTRAINT 2: Signal Characteristics

**Evidence:**
- Narrowband (less than 10 kHz bandwidth)
- Strong intensity (30× background noise)
- Duration: 72 seconds (exactly what telescope sweep would show for fixed cosmic source)
- Rise-fall pattern matched antenna beam pattern perfectly

**What this means:** 
- Narrowband = likely artificial (natural sources are typically broadband)
- Duration = consistent with sidereal (star-fixed) source
- Pattern = source was where the telescope was pointing

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Equipment malfunction (wouldn't produce perfect beam-pattern match)
- ❌ Nearby terrestrial source (wouldn't match sidereal timing)

**Solution space remaining:** Distant deliberate transmission, satellite at right position, natural narrowband source, ET

**DAMNING POWER: HIGH**

---

### CONSTRAINT 3: No Repeat Detection

**Evidence:**
- 100+ follow-up observations of same sky position
- Multiple telescopes over decades
- Never detected again
- Big Ear monitored for years afterward — nothing

**What this means:** Either:
- One-time event (natural transient)
- Directed transmission not repeated toward Earth
- Moving source (satellite, comet)
- Intermittent transmission we haven't caught again

**PARTIALLY ELIMINATES:**
- ⚠️ Weakens "deliberate beacon" hypothesis (beacons repeat)
- ⚠️ Consistent with one-time natural event
- ⚠️ Consistent with directed transmission (not a beacon)

**Solution space remaining:** All options weakened but not eliminated

**DAMNING POWER: MODERATE** (constrains but doesn't eliminate)

---

### CONSTRAINT 4: Location Analysis

**Evidence:**
- Originated from Sagittarius constellation
- Near Chi Sagittarii star group
- No known astronomical source at that exact position
- 2017 hypothesis: Comet 266P/Christensen was in that region

**The comet hypothesis:**
- Comets can emit at hydrogen frequency (hydrogen in coma)
- 266P was potentially in the beam
- But: Other astronomers dispute the orbital calculations
- And: No comet has been observed producing such a strong, narrowband signal

**PARTIALLY ELIMINATES:**
- ⚠️ Comet hypothesis is contested but not definitively ruled out

**Solution space remaining:** Contested comet hypothesis, unknown natural source, ET

**DAMNING POWER: LOW** (no clear elimination)

---

### CONSTRAINT 5: No Modulation Detected

**Evidence:**
- If the signal contained information, we couldn't extract it
- Appeared as pure carrier wave
- 72 seconds too short to analyze for patterns

**What this means:**
- If ET: Could be beacon, could be carrier for message we missed
- If natural: Consistent with astronomical source
- Doesn't distinguish between hypotheses

**DAMNING POWER: NONE** (constrains nothing)

---

## THE PROBLEM: CONSTRAINTS DON'T CONVERGE

Unlike Tic Tac (where constraints eliminated everything except one option), the Wow! Signal constraints narrow the space but leave multiple viable options:

| Hypothesis | Status After Constraints |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Random terrestrial interference | ❌ Eliminated (frequency, timing) |
| Equipment malfunction | ❌ Eliminated (beam pattern match) |
| Known satellite | ❌ Eliminated (no satellite identified) |
| Comet 266P | ⚠️ Contested — maybe 20% |
| Unknown natural phenomenon | ⚠️ Possible — maybe 30% |
| Extraterrestrial intelligence | ⚠️ Possible — maybe 40% |
| Unknown unknown | ⚠️ Always possible — 10% |

---

## ANOMALIES

**"Why only 72 seconds?"**
→ That's how long the source was in the telescope beam. Consistent with any fixed cosmic source. Not anomalous.

**"Why no repeat?"**
→ Genuinely problematic for "beacon" hypothesis. But consistent with directed transmission, natural transient, or intermittent source we haven't caught.

**"Why so strong?"**
→ Unknown. Could indicate powerful transmitter. Could indicate natural amplification. Constrains nothing definitively.

---

## FINAL SOLUTION SPACE

This case is different. Constraints eliminate some options but don't narrow to one:

| Hypothesis | Probability |
|------------|-------------|
| Terrestrial/equipment | ❌ ~5% |
| Comet | ~15% |
| Unknown natural | ~30% |
| ET signal | ~40% |
| Unknown unknown | ~10% |

## CONVICTION: LOW (Genuine Uncertainty)

**The honest answer:** We don't know what the Wow! Signal was.

Constraint stacking eliminates terrestrial interference and equipment error. But it doesn't distinguish between:
- Natural phenomenon we don't understand
- Extraterrestrial transmission

**This is what genuine uncertainty looks like.** The constraints narrow the space but leave multiple viable options. Unlike the Tic Tac, we cannot reach high conviction.

**Conclusion:** The Wow! Signal remains genuinely mysterious. P(ET) ≈ 40% is defensible. So is P(natural) ≈ 50%. Anyone claiming certainty either direction is overconfident.

---

## Why This Case Matters

The Wow! Signal demonstrates that constraint stacking doesn't always produce a clear answer. When constraints don't converge, the honest output is: **uncertain.**

The method tells you when you know something and when you don't.

Here, we don't.
