result: Cannot eliminate — ET signal OR unknown natural source
status: complete
---

August 15, 1977. Big Ear radio telescope, Ohio. Astronomer Jerry Ehman saw a data printout showing an anomalous signal. He circled it and wrote "Wow!"

The signal matched exactly what we'd expect from an extraterrestrial transmission. It's never been explained. It's never repeated.

What survives constraint stacking?

## CONSTRAINT STACKING ANALYSIS

**CLAIM:** What was the Wow! Signal?

**STARTING SOLUTION SPACE:**
- Terrestrial interference (Earth-based radio)
- Satellite reflection
- Equipment malfunction
- Natural astronomical source (comet, quasar, etc.)
- Extraterrestrial intelligence
- Unknown natural phenomenon

---

### CONSTRAINT 1 (MOST DAMNING): The Frequency — 1420.405 MHz

**Evidence:**
- Signal was at hydrogen line frequency (21cm wavelength)
- This is the most logical frequency for interstellar communication:
  - Most abundant element in universe
  - Naturally "quiet" band
  - Any technical civilization would know it
- International agreements protect this frequency from terrestrial transmission

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Random terrestrial interference (protected frequency)
- ❌ Random equipment noise (wouldn't land exactly on hydrogen line)

**Remaining:** Deliberate terrestrial transmission, satellite, natural astronomical source, ET, unknown phenomenon

---

### CONSTRAINT 2: Signal Characteristics

**Evidence:**
- Narrowband (less than 10 kHz bandwidth)
- Strong intensity (30× background noise)
- Duration: 72 seconds (exactly what telescope sweep would show for fixed cosmic source)
- Rise-fall pattern matched antenna beam pattern perfectly

**What this means:** 
- Narrowband = likely artificial (natural sources typically broadband)
- Duration = consistent with sidereal (star-fixed) source
- Pattern = source was where the telescope was pointing

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Equipment malfunction (wouldn't produce perfect beam-pattern match)
- ❌ Nearby terrestrial source (wouldn't match sidereal timing)

**Remaining:** Distant deliberate transmission, satellite at right position, natural narrowband source, ET

---

### CONSTRAINT 3: No Repeat Detection

**Evidence:**
- 100+ follow-up observations of same sky position
- Multiple telescopes over decades
- Never detected again

**What this means:** Either one-time event, directed transmission not repeated toward Earth, moving source, or intermittent source we haven't caught.

**PARTIALLY CONSTRAINS:**
- ⚠️ Weakens "deliberate beacon" hypothesis (beacons repeat)
- ⚠️ Consistent with one-time natural event
- ⚠️ Consistent with directed transmission (not a beacon)

**Remaining:** All options weakened but not eliminated

---

### CONSTRAINT 4: Location Analysis

**Evidence:**
- Originated from Sagittarius constellation
- No known astronomical source at exact position
- 2017 comet hypothesis (266P/Christensen) — contested

**The comet hypothesis:**
- Comets can emit at hydrogen frequency
- 266P was potentially in the beam
- But: orbital calculations disputed, no comet observed producing such strong narrowband signal

**PARTIALLY CONSTRAINS:**
- ⚠️ Comet hypothesis contested but not eliminated

**Remaining:** Contested comet, unknown natural source, ET

---

## THE PROBLEM: CONSTRAINTS DON'T CONVERGE

Unlike other cases, the Wow! Signal constraints narrow the space but leave multiple viable options. We cannot eliminate down to one.

---

## RESULT

| Hypothesis | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Random terrestrial interference | ❌ Eliminated |
| Equipment malfunction | ❌ Eliminated |
| Known satellite | ❌ Eliminated |
| Comet 266P | **Cannot eliminate** (contested) |
| Unknown natural phenomenon | **Cannot eliminate** |
| Extraterrestrial signal | **Cannot eliminate** |

## What This Means

We are not saying "the Wow! Signal was ET" or "the Wow! Signal was natural."

We are saying: "We eliminated terrestrial interference and equipment error. Multiple hypotheses survive: natural source, comet, or ET transmission. The constraints don't distinguish between them."

**This is what genuine uncertainty looks like.** The method tells you when you know something and when you don't.

Here, we don't.
