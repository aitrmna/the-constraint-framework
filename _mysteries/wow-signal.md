August 15, 1977. The Big Ear radio telescope in Ohio was scanning the sky for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence.

Three days later, astronomer Jerry Ehman was reviewing the printout. He saw a sequence that made him grab a red pen and circle it. In the margin, he wrote one word:

**"Wow!"**

That signal remains the strongest candidate for extraterrestrial contact ever detected. Nearly 50 years later, we still don't know what it was.

## What Happened

The Big Ear telescope was part of SETI — the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. It scanned the sky looking for artificial radio signals.

On that night, it picked up something unusual. The signal:

- Lasted 72 seconds (exactly how long the telescope's beam would see a fixed point in space)
- Was at 1420 MHz — the frequency of hydrogen, the most common element in the universe
- Was narrowband — a tight, focused frequency, not the broad splatter of natural sources
- Was strong — 30 times louder than background noise
- Came from the direction of Sagittarius, toward the center of our galaxy
- Matched the expected signature of an artificial transmission

The data looked like this: **6EQUJ5**

Each character represents signal intensity. The "U" represents a signal 30 times stronger than normal background. It rose, peaked, and fell exactly as expected for a source fixed in space passing through the telescope's beam.

## Why 1420 MHz Matters

This frequency isn't random. It's the emission frequency of neutral hydrogen — the most abundant element in the universe.

Scientists call the region around 1420 MHz the "water hole." The idea: if aliens wanted to communicate, they'd pick a frequency that any technological civilization would know about. Hydrogen is universal. Any species doing radio astronomy would find it.

It's also internationally protected. No Earth transmitters are allowed to broadcast at 1420 MHz. This makes terrestrial interference less likely.

The Wow! Signal was at exactly the frequency SETI was designed to detect.

## What Happened Next

Nothing.

The Big Ear telescope looked at the same spot the next night. Nothing. Astronomers have pointed telescopes at that location over 100 times since. Nothing.

The signal never repeated.

## The Hypotheses

1. **Extraterrestrial transmission** — Someone out there sent it
2. **Earth-based interference** — A terrestrial signal bounced off something
3. **Satellite** — A spacecraft transmitted at that frequency
4. **Comet with hydrogen cloud** — Natural hydrogen emission from a passing comet
5. **Equipment malfunction** — The telescope glitched
6. **Natural astronomical source** — Some exotic object we don't understand

---

## Testing the Explanations

### 1. Earth-Based Interference

**The claim:** A signal from Earth (radar, transmitter, electronics) somehow reached the telescope.

**Problems:**

- 1420 MHz is protected — no licensed transmitters operate there
- The signal tracked with the stars, not with Earth's rotation
- It rose and fell exactly as a celestial source would
- Big Ear had two "horns" — an interference signal would appear in both; this appeared in only one

**Verdict:** The signal behaved like something in space, not something on Earth. Local interference doesn't fit the data.

**Survival probability:** ~5%

### 2. Satellite

**The claim:** A satellite transmitted at 1420 MHz, either accidentally or deliberately.

**Problems:**

- No satellites are allowed to transmit at 1420 MHz (protected frequency)
- Satellite databases from 1977 show nothing in that position
- A satellite would move relative to the stars — this signal was fixed
- Why would a satellite transmit once and never again?

**Verdict:** Possible in principle, but no evidence supports it. Would require an unknown, unlicensed satellite doing something strange.

**Survival probability:** ~5%

### 3. Comet with Hydrogen Cloud (2017 Theory)

**The claim:** Astronomer Antonio Paris proposed that comets 266P/Christensen and P/2008 Y2 were in that region of sky in 1977. Comets release hydrogen gas. Maybe that's what Big Ear detected.

**What it would explain:**

- Hydrogen emission at 1420 MHz
- One-time event (comet moved on)
- Natural source

**Problems:**

- Those comets weren't discovered until 2006 and 2008 — their 1977 positions are calculated backwards, with uncertainty
- Other astronomers checked: the comets probably weren't in the beam
- Comet hydrogen clouds produce weak, broad signals — not strong, narrowband ones
- Paris claimed to detect 266P in 2017, but his methodology was criticized
- The signal was too strong for a typical comet
- No other comet has ever produced a signal like this

**Verdict:** This got a lot of press but doesn't hold up. The physics doesn't work. Comets don't produce signals like this.

**Survival probability:** ~5%

### 4. Equipment Malfunction

**The claim:** The telescope or its electronics glitched.

**Problems:**

- The signal had the exact profile of a real celestial source
- It rose and fell over 72 seconds — matching the beam width perfectly
- A glitch would look random, not like a textbook extraterrestrial signal
- The telescope was well-maintained and understood
- No similar glitches before or after

**Verdict:** Equipment failures don't produce signals that perfectly mimic what you're looking for. This would be an extraordinary coincidence.

**Survival probability:** ~3%

### 5. Natural Astronomical Source

**The claim:** Some natural object — a pulsar, quasar, or unknown phenomenon — produced the signal.

**Problems:**

- Natural sources are broadband (spread across many frequencies); this was narrowband
- Natural sources repeat or persist; this happened once
- Nothing in that region of sky explains it
- No known natural process produces this signature

**What it would require:** A completely unknown type of astronomical object that:

- Emits narrowband radio at exactly 1420 MHz
- Does so once and never again
- Hasn't been detected anywhere else in the sky

**Verdict:** Possible — the universe is weird — but no evidence for it. You're inventing an unknown phenomenon to avoid another unknown phenomenon.

**Survival probability:** ~10%

### 6. Extraterrestrial Transmission

**The claim:** An intelligent civilization transmitted a signal, and we caught it.

**What it explains:**

- The frequency (hydrogen line — logical choice for communication)
- Narrowband signal (artificial sources are focused)
- The strength (a deliberate transmission would be powerful)
- Why it matched SETI's search parameters exactly

**Problems:**

- Why only 72 seconds?
- Why never repeat?
- No information content detected (just a carrier signal)
- Extraordinary claim requires extraordinary evidence

**Possible answers to the problems:**

- Maybe they weren't transmitting to us — we caught a beacon or radar sweep
- Maybe they did repeat, but not when we were looking
- Maybe it was a "ping" — announcing presence, not sending data
- Maybe they stopped transmitting (civilizations rise and fall)

**Verdict:** This is the explanation that fits the signal's characteristics best. But "fits best" doesn't mean "proven." It's consistent with the data, but so is "something we don't understand yet."

**Survival probability:** ~40%

## The Math

| Hypothesis | Survival Probability |
|------------|---------------------|
| Extraterrestrial transmission | ~40% |
| Unknown natural phenomenon | ~10% |
| Earth-based interference | ~5% |
| Satellite | ~5% |
| Comet | ~5% |
| Equipment malfunction | ~3% |
| Something else entirely | ~32% |

Notice that big "something else" category. This case is genuinely uncertain. Unlike the Tic Tac (where we have multiple sensors and witnesses) or Dyatlov (where a natural explanation covers the facts), the Wow! Signal gives us almost nothing to work with. One data point. 72 seconds. No repeat.

---

## Why This Is Hard

The Wow! Signal is frustrating because it's exactly what we'd expect from ET — and exactly what we can't prove.

Think about it:

- If aliens transmitted at a random frequency, we might miss it
- They chose the one frequency any civilization would monitor
- If the signal were broadband, it could be natural
- It was narrowband — the signature of technology
- If it came from Earth's direction, we'd suspect interference
- It came from deep space, tracked with the stars

The signal matched every criterion for "probably artificial." And then it never came back.

We're left with a perfect candidate and no way to confirm it.

---

## What This Doesn't Tell Us

Even if it was extraterrestrial, we don't know:

- Who sent it
- Whether it was meant for us
- Why it didn't repeat
- What (if anything) it meant
- How far away the source was

The signal carried no detectable information — just a carrier wave. If it was a message, we don't know what it said. If it was a beacon, we don't know what it was marking.

---

## The Honest Position

**What we know:**

- Something produced a signal at exactly the frequency SETI predicted
- It had characteristics inconsistent with known natural sources
- It wasn't local interference
- It never repeated

**What we don't know:**

- What it was

The Wow! Signal is genuinely unexplained. Not "unexplained because we haven't tried" — unexplained after nearly 50 years of analysis. The mundane explanations don't fit well. The exotic explanation can't be confirmed.

We're stuck.

---

## Why It Matters

If this was an extraterrestrial signal, it means:

- We're not alone
- Someone out there uses radio technology
- They're in our galaxy, probably within a few hundred light-years
- They either stopped transmitting or we got lucky catching a brief signal

If it wasn't, it means:

- There's a natural phenomenon we don't understand
- Or: someone on Earth did something weird in 1977 and we can't figure out what

Either way, the signal represents a gap in our understanding.

---

## The Takeaway

The Wow! Signal is the best evidence we have that someone might be out there. It's also deeply inconclusive.

This is what real scientific mysteries look like. Not "clearly aliens" or "clearly natural" — but something that doesn't fit our categories and refuses to repeat so we can study it.

The honest answer is: **We don't know.**

The framework tells us that ET is more consistent with the data than mundane explanations. But "more consistent" with one data point isn't proof. It's a hint. A frustrating, tantalizing, 72-second hint that's been haunting astronomers for almost half a century.
