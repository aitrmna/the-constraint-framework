December 26-28, 1980. RAF Woodbridge, Suffolk, England. US Air Force personnel encountered lights and phenomena in Rendlesham Forest over three nights. Deputy Base Commander Lt. Col. Charles Halt made real-time audio recording during investigation. Radiation readings taken, ground traces documented. Known as "Britain's Roswell."

**A case where evidence genuinely splits.**

## THE MYSTERY

**Core Question:** What occurred in Rendlesham Forest, December 1980?

**Key Evidence:**
- Multiple military witnesses (5+)
- Real-time audio recording (Lt. Col. Halt)
- Radiation readings (0.1 milliroentgens above background)
- Ground depressions (triangular pattern)
- Broken tree branches
- Orford Ness lighthouse visible 5 miles away
- Meteor reported night one

---

## COMPETING HYPOTHESES

**H1: Lighthouse + Misidentification**
- Orford Ness lighthouse caused confusion
- Meteor night one added to excitement
- Unfamiliar personnel misinterpreted

**H2: Unknown Technology**
- Actual craft landed
- Physical traces from event
- Multiple credible witnesses

---

## PREDICTIONS & TESTING

### H1: Lighthouse Misidentification

**Predictions:**

1. **Lighthouse visible from forest** → ✓ **PASS**
   - Orford Ness lighthouse 5 miles away
   - Rotating beam every 5 seconds
   - Visible through trees

2. **Witnesses unfamiliar with area** → ✓ **PASS**
   - US personnel recently stationed
   - Not local to Suffolk

3. **Radiation readings background level** → ⚠️ **UNCLEAR**
   - 0.1 milliroentgens above background
   - Slight elevation, but within noise

4. **Physical traces explainable** → ⚠️ **UNCLEAR**
   - Depressions could be animal activity
   - OR could be landing marks
   - Ambiguous

5. **Halt audio shows confusion** → ✓ **PASS**
   - Recording shows searching for explanation
   - Excitement, uncertainty
   - Consistent with misidentification

**Score:** 3/5 with 2 unclear = ~60%
**Overall Fit:** **~50%** (accounting for ambiguity)

---

### H2: Unknown Technology

**Predictions:**

1. **Multiple independent witnesses** → ✓ **PASS**
   - 5+ military personnel
   - Over three nights
   - Consistent core details

2. **Physical traces** → ⚠️ **UNCLEAR**
   - Depressions photographed
   - Radiation slightly elevated
   - Could be mundane OR anomalous

3. **Audio recording captures anomaly** → ⚠️ **UNCLEAR**
   - Halt describes lights
   - Excitement evident
   - Could be lighthouse OR unknown

4. **Deputy Base Commander credibility** → ✓ **PASS**
   - Halt was high-ranking officer
   - Made real-time recording
   - Stood by account for decades

5. **No obvious mundane match** → ✗ **FAIL**
   - Lighthouse is obvious candidate
   - Meteor explains night one
   - Mundane explanations exist

**Score:** 2/5 with 2 unclear = ~40%
**Overall Fit:** **~35%** (lighthouse is strong alternative)

---

## COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

| Hypothesis | Overall Fit |
|-----------|-------------|
| Lighthouse + Misidentification | ~50% |
| Unknown Technology | ~35% |

**Advantage Ratio:** 1.4:1

**Interpretation:** Too close to call. Evidence genuinely ambiguous.

---

## WHY THIS CASE IS AMBIGUOUS

**Evidence pointing to lighthouse:**
- Lighthouse exists, was visible
- Timing matches rotating beam
- Personnel unfamiliar with area
- Excitement/confusion evident in audio

**Evidence pointing to anomaly:**
- Multiple nights (lighthouse always there - why only notice then?)
- Multiple trained observers
- Physical traces (though weak)
- High-ranking officer witness

**Neither explanation is overwhelming.**

---

## WHAT THIS SHOWS

**The framework handling genuine ambiguity:**

Not every case has clear answer. Sometimes evidence splits.

**Compare to:**
- **Tic Tac:** 12:1 advantage, clear winner
- **Belgian Wave:** Infinite ratio, clear debunk
- **Rendlesham:** 1.4:1, genuinely unclear

**This is honest assessment.**

**What would resolve it:**
- More physical evidence from 1980 (lost to time)
- Additional witnesses coming forward
- Better understanding of lighthouse visibility patterns
- Radiation readings from control samples

**Without these:** Case remains ambiguous.

---

## HONEST CONCLUSION

**Most likely:** Lighthouse misidentification (slight edge)

**But:** Cannot confidently eliminate unknown technology

**Confidence:** Low (evidence too ambiguous)

**This case shows framework's limits:**
When evidence is genuinely split, framework says "split." That's the right answer.
