December 26-28, 1980. RAF Woodbridge, Suffolk. US Air Force personnel encountered lights in Rendlesham Forest over three nights. Deputy Base Commander Lt. Col. Charles Halt made real-time audio recording. Radiation readings taken, ground traces documented.

**A case where evidence genuinely splits.**

**The test:** What must be true for each explanation? Does reality match?

## Competing Hypotheses

1. Lighthouse + misidentification
2. Unknown technology

---

## H1: Lighthouse + Misidentification

**What must be true:**
- Orford Ness lighthouse visible from forest
- Personnel unfamiliar with area
- Physical traces explainable by mundane causes
- Halt audio shows confusion/uncertainty

**Reality check:**

**Lighthouse visible?** → ✓ PASS
- Orford Ness lighthouse 5 miles away
- Rotating beam every 5 seconds
- Visible through trees

**Unfamiliar personnel?** → ✓ PASS
- US personnel recently stationed
- Not local to Suffolk area

**Physical traces mundane?** → ⚠️ UNCLEAR
- Depressions photographed (triangular pattern)
- Could be animal activity OR landing marks
- Radiation 0.1 milliroentgens above background (marginal)
- Genuinely ambiguous

**Audio shows confusion?** → ✓ PASS
- Recording shows searching for explanation
- Excitement, uncertainty evident
- Consistent with misidentification

**Score:** 3/4 passes, 1 unclear
Calculation: 75% × (1 - 0) = **75%**

Adjusted for ambiguity: **~50%** (unclear evidence weakens confidence)

## H2: Unknown Technology

**What must be true:**
- Multiple independent witnesses
- Physical evidence of landing
- Audio captures genuine anomaly
- High-ranking credible witness
- No obvious mundane explanation

**Reality check:**

**Multiple witnesses?** → ✓ PASS
- 5+ military personnel
- Over three nights
- Consistent core details

**Physical evidence?** → ⚠️ UNCLEAR
- Depressions and radiation readings exist
- Could be mundane OR anomalous
- Ambiguous interpretation

**Audio captures anomaly?** → ⚠️ UNCLEAR
- Halt describes lights and excitement
- Could be lighthouse OR unknown
- Unclear from recording alone

**Credible witness?** → ✓ PASS
- Lt. Col. Halt (Deputy Base Commander)
- Made contemporaneous recording
- Stood by account for decades

**No mundane explanation?** → ✗ FAIL
- Lighthouse is obvious candidate
- Meteor on night one
- Mundane alternatives exist

**Score:** 2/5 passes, 2 unclear, 1 fail
Calculation: 40% × (1 - 0) = **40%**

Adjusted for unclear: **~35%**

## Comparison

| Hypothesis | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| Lighthouse + Misidentification | ~50% |
| Unknown Technology | ~35% |

**Advantage:** 1.4:1 for lighthouse

**Interpretation:** Too close to call. Evidence genuinely ambiguous.

---

## Why This Is Ambiguous

**For lighthouse:**
- Lighthouse exists and was visible
- Timing matches rotating beam
- Personnel unfamiliar with area
- Confusion evident in audio

**For unknown:**
- Multiple nights (lighthouse always there—why notice only then?)
- Multiple trained observers
- Physical traces (though weak)
- High-ranking officer witness

**Neither explanation dominates.**

## What This Shows

**The framework handling genuine ambiguity:**

Not every case has a clear answer. Sometimes evidence splits.

**Compare:**
- **Tic Tac:** 15:1 advantage (clear winner)
- **Belgian Wave:** Infinite ratio (clear debunk)
- **Rendlesham:** 1.4:1 (genuinely unclear)

**This is honest assessment.**

---

**Most likely:** Lighthouse misidentification (slight edge)
**Cannot eliminate:** Unknown technology
**Confidence:** Low (evidence too ambiguous)

When evidence splits, framework says "split." That's the correct answer.
