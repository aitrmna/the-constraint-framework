Galaxies rotate wrong.

Stars at the edges orbit as fast as stars near the center. Newtonian gravity says they should fly off. They don't.

Two explanations:

**Dark Matter:** There's invisible mass we can't see — 5x more than visible matter. It holds galaxies together.

**MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics):** Gravity works differently at very low accelerations. No invisible mass needed.

Both have evidence. Both have problems. 40 years of debate. Let's apply constraint stacking.

## CONSTRAINT STACKING ANALYSIS

**CLAIM BEING TESTED:** What explains the galaxy rotation problem?

**Solution space:**
- Dark matter (invisible particles)
- MOND (modified gravity)
- Something else
- Unknown

---

## PART 1: Testing Dark Matter

### CONSTRAINT 1 (MOST DAMNING): No Particle Found

**The evidence:**
- 40+ years of direct detection experiments
- LUX, XENON, PandaX — increasingly sensitive detectors
- Billions of dollars spent
- Result: Nothing

**What was expected:**
- WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) were the leading candidate
- Should have been detected by now if they exist at predicted masses
- Parameter space is shrinking dramatically

**Problem for dark matter:** The most motivated particle candidates are being ruled out. We keep not finding what we're looking for.

**Dark matter response:** Maybe it's a different particle. Axions, sterile neutrinos, primordial black holes.

**Assessment:** Not fatal, but significant. 40 years of "we'll find it soon" hasn't delivered.

---

### CONSTRAINT 2: Galaxy Cluster Dynamics

**The evidence:**
- Clusters of galaxies also show missing mass
- The mass deficit in clusters is LARGER than in galaxies
- Gravitational lensing confirms: more mass than we see

**Problem for dark matter?** No — this is evidence FOR dark matter.

**The constraint:** Whatever explains rotation curves must ALSO explain cluster dynamics.

**Assessment:** Dark matter handles clusters naturally. Point for dark matter.

---

### CONSTRAINT 3: The Bullet Cluster

**The evidence:**
- Two galaxy clusters collided
- Normal matter (gas) slowed down in the collision — detected by X-rays
- Gravitational lensing shows mass is SEPARATE from the gas
- The mass kept going; the gas got stuck

**What this suggests:**
- The mass doesn't interact with itself (passed through)
- Normal matter interacts (got stuck)
- The mass and the visible matter separated

**Problem for MOND:** If there's no dark matter, the mass should be where the visible matter is. It's not.

**Dark matter interpretation:** Dark matter particles passed through each other. Normal matter collided. Separation is natural.

**Assessment:** Strong evidence for dark matter. Often called the "smoking gun."

---

### CONSTRAINT 4: Cosmic Microwave Background

**The evidence:**
- CMB shows tiny temperature fluctuations from early universe
- The pattern of fluctuations matches dark matter models precisely
- Baryon acoustic oscillations — the "sound" of the early universe — fit dark matter predictions

**Problem for dark matter?** No — this is strong evidence FOR dark matter.

**Assessment:** CMB is one of dark matter's biggest successes. The fit is remarkable.

---

### CONSTRAINT 5: Large-Scale Structure

**The evidence:**
- Galaxies cluster in filaments and voids — the "cosmic web"
- Simulations with dark matter reproduce this structure
- Without dark matter, structure formation is too slow

**Problem for dark matter?** No — evidence FOR.

**Assessment:** Dark matter models match observations well.

---

### CONSTRAINT 6: Small-Scale Problems

**The evidence:**
- Dark matter simulations predict more small satellite galaxies than we observe ("missing satellites")
- Predicted density profiles don't match observed ("cusp-core problem")
- Simulated galaxies are too dense in the center

**Problem for dark matter:** The theory works at large scales but has issues at small scales.

**Dark matter response:** Baryonic physics (star formation, supernovae) might solve these. Complex simulations are improving.

**Assessment:** Genuine problem, not necessarily fatal. Active research area.

---

## PART 2: Testing MOND

### CONSTRAINT 7: Galaxy Rotation Curves

**The evidence:**
- MOND was DESIGNED to explain rotation curves
- One parameter (a₀) fits hundreds of galaxies
- Predictions often work better than dark matter for individual galaxies
- Tully-Fisher relation falls out naturally

**Problem for MOND?** No — this is MOND's strength.

**Assessment:** MOND excels here. Remarkably predictive with minimal parameters.

---

### CONSTRAINT 8: The Bullet Cluster (Revisited)

**The problem for MOND:**
- Mass is separated from visible matter
- MOND says gravity is where matter is
- The lensing mass isn't where the visible matter is

**MOND responses:**
- Some MOND advocates dispute the analysis
- TeVeS (relativistic MOND) might explain it with additional fields
- Maybe some dark matter is needed (hybrid models)

**Assessment:** Serious problem for pure MOND. The Bullet Cluster is hard to explain without some form of dark matter.

---

### CONSTRAINT 9: Galaxy Clusters

**The problem for MOND:**
- MOND explains galaxy rotation curves with one parameter
- But clusters STILL have missing mass even with MOND
- MOND reduces the deficit but doesn't eliminate it

**What this means:**
- MOND alone isn't enough for clusters
- Either MOND is wrong, or there's ALSO some dark matter, or there's another effect

**Assessment:** Significant problem. MOND doesn't fully work at cluster scales.

---

### CONSTRAINT 10: Cosmic Microwave Background

**The problem for MOND:**
- Standard MOND doesn't address cosmology
- The CMB fit requires something like dark matter
- Relativistic extensions (TeVeS) have struggled

**MOND response:**
- MOND is primarily about galaxies
- Cosmology requires relativistic extension, still in development
- Some proposals exist but none as successful as dark matter

**Assessment:** Major gap in MOND. The CMB success of dark matter is hard to match.

---

### CONSTRAINT 11: The Fine-Tuning of a₀

**The observation:**
- MOND's critical acceleration a₀ ≈ 1.2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m/s²
- This is suspiciously close to cH₀ (speed of light × Hubble constant)
- Why would a gravitational parameter relate to cosmological expansion?

**Two interpretations:**

**For MOND:** This isn't coincidence — it suggests MOND is onto something deep. Gravity really does connect to cosmology.

**For dark matter:** Just coincidence. Or we don't understand why yet.

**Assessment:** Intriguing hint. Either profound or coincidence. Doesn't resolve the debate.

## THE WEIGHING

### Dark Matter Scorecard

| Evidence | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Galaxy rotation curves | ✓ Explains (with fitted halo profiles) |
| Galaxy clusters | ✓ Explains naturally |
| Bullet Cluster | ✓ Strong evidence |
| CMB | ✓ Excellent fit |
| Large-scale structure | ✓ Reproduces observations |
| No particle found (40 years) | ✗ Significant problem |
| Small-scale issues | ⚠️ Problems, possibly solvable |

### MOND Scorecard

| Evidence | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Galaxy rotation curves | ✓ Excellent — one parameter fits all |
| Galaxy clusters | ✗ Still has missing mass |
| Bullet Cluster | ✗ Hard to explain |
| CMB | ✗ No good fit without dark matter-like component |
| Large-scale structure | ⚠️ Underdeveloped |
| a₀ coincidence | ? Intriguing but unexplained |

---

## CONSTRAINT 12: What Type of Evidence?

Applying our evidence hierarchy:

**Dark matter:**
- FOR: Unexplained observations that FIT (CMB, Bullet Cluster, clusters) — strong
- AGAINST: Absence of detection — moderate (absence isn't proof)

**MOND:**
- FOR: Elegant explanation of rotation curves — strong
- AGAINST: Observations it CAN'T explain (Bullet Cluster, clusters, CMB) — these are anomalies for MOND

**The asymmetry:**

Dark matter's problem is *absence* (no particle found).
MOND's problems are *anomalies* (things it can't explain).

By our weighting: Unexplained anomalies > absence of evidence.

MOND has unexplained anomalies. Dark matter has absence.

---

## RESULT

| Hypothesis | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Pure Dark Matter | ⚠️ Explains most, but 40 years no particle. Small-scale issues. |
| Pure MOND | ❌ Cannot explain Bullet Cluster, clusters, CMB without help |
| Dark Matter + modified gravity | Cannot eliminate |
| Something deeper | Cannot eliminate |

---

## WHAT THIS SUGGESTS

Neither paradigm is fully satisfactory.

**Dark matter:**
- Works phenomenally at large scales
- But we've never found the particle
- And small-scale predictions have issues

**MOND:**
- Works remarkably well for galaxies
- With suspicious elegance (one parameter, a₀ coincidence)
- But can't handle clusters or cosmology without help

**The pattern:**

MOND works where it was designed to work (galaxies).
Dark matter works where IT was designed to work (large scales, cosmology).
Neither fully works for the other's domain.

**Possible interpretations:**

1. **Dark matter exists but isn't WIMPs.** We're looking for the wrong particle. Maybe axions, primordial black holes, or something else.

2. **Dark matter exists AND gravity is modified.** Both effects are real. Some proposals combine them.

3. **Something deeper.** Both are approximations to a more fundamental theory we don't have yet. The a₀ coincidence might be a hint.

4. **Emergent gravity.** Gravity itself might emerge from something else (Verlinde's entropic gravity, for instance). "Dark matter" might be an effect, not a substance.

---

## THE HONEST CONCLUSION

Pure MOND is effectively eliminated by the Bullet Cluster and cluster dynamics.

Pure dark matter survives but has a 40-year detection problem and small-scale issues.

**What survives:**
- Dark matter (with caveats)
- Hybrid models
- Something deeper we don't yet understand

**The a₀ coincidence haunts both sides.** Why would a gravitational parameter equal cH₀? That's either profound or the universe mocking us.

---

## WHAT WOULD RESOLVE THIS

**For dark matter:**
- Detect the particle. Any particle. This would end the debate.
- Solve small-scale problems convincingly.

**For MOND:**
- Explain the Bullet Cluster without dark matter.
- Develop a relativistic version that fits CMB.
- Explain why a₀ = cH₀.

**For "something deeper":**
- A theory that derives both dark matter phenomenology AND MOND behavior from first principles.
- Explains the a₀ coincidence.
- Predicts something new that we can test.

---

## THE EDGE

This is one of the genuinely open problems in physics.

The constraint stacking shows:
- Pure MOND doesn't work (Bullet Cluster, clusters, CMB)
- Dark matter works better but has a detection problem
- Something might be missing from our understanding of gravity at multiple scales

**In 50 years, someone might look back and say:** "They knew MOND was onto something with galaxies, and they knew dark matter was needed for large scales, but they hadn't yet found the theory that unified both."

Or: "They finally detected axions in 2035 and the debate ended."

We don't know which. That's what makes it interesting.
