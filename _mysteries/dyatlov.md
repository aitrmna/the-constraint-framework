result: Natural causes — katabatic wind + slab avalanche (90% conviction)
status: complete
---

February 1959. Nine experienced hikers died on Kholat Syakhl in the Ural Mountains. They cut their way out of their tent in the middle of the night, fled into -30°C temperatures without proper clothing, and scattered. Some had strange injuries. Soviet investigators concluded "compelling natural force."

For 65 years, people have proposed: secret military tests, Yeti, UFOs, infrasound-induced panic, murder.

What survives constraint stacking?

## CONSTRAINT STACKING ANALYSIS

**CLAIM:** What killed the Dyatlov group?

**STARTING SOLUTION SPACE:**
- Avalanche
- Katabatic wind event
- Hypothermia (simple exposure)
- Murder (by humans)
- Military weapons test
- Animal attack
- Infrasound panic
- Unknown phenomenon

---

### CONSTRAINT 1 (MOST DAMNING): They Cut Out From Inside

**Evidence:**
- Tent was cut from inside (knife cuts slope inward)
- Multiple cuts made hastily
- Footprints show orderly departure (not chaotic scramble)

**What this means:** Whatever happened, they chose to leave. Quickly. Through the tent wall rather than the entrance.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Murder by outsiders (attackers don't wait inside while victims cut their way out)
- ❌ Animal inside tent (would have torn tent, not knife cuts)
- ❌ Simple hypothermia (doesn't explain urgent exit)

**Solution space remaining:** Avalanche, katabatic wind, military test, infrasound, unknown phenomenon

**DAMNING POWER: HIGH**

---

### CONSTRAINT 2: No External Attackers

**Evidence:**
- Only group's footprints in snow
- No other tracks for miles
- No signs of struggle with outsiders
- Nothing stolen from camp

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Murder by other humans
- ❌ Military personnel on scene
- ❌ Any external agent requiring physical presence

**Solution space remaining:** Avalanche, katabatic wind, military test (remote), infrasound, unknown phenomenon

**DAMNING POWER: MASSIVE**

---

### CONSTRAINT 3: The Injuries Pattern

**Evidence:**
- Two had major chest fractures (force comparable to car crash)
- One missing tongue (post-mortem, in stream)
- Others died of hypothermia with minor injuries
- Fractures showed no external wounds (crushing force, not blunt impact)

**What this means:** Massive internal pressure without surface damage = compression force, not beating. Consistent with:
- Snow mass compression (avalanche/snow shelter collapse)
- Falling into ravine

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Beating/attack (would show external wounds)
- ❌ Weapons (would show penetration or surface damage)
- ❌ Simple exposure (doesn't explain compression fractures)

**Solution space remaining:** Avalanche, katabatic wind + secondary injury, unknown phenomenon

**DAMNING POWER: HIGH**

---

### CONSTRAINT 4: The Timeline and Behavior

**Evidence:**
- Fled tent urgently (cut through wall)
- Walked 1.5km downhill in orderly fashion
- Split into groups
- Some built fire, some built snow shelter
- Those in ravine had worst injuries
- Injuries consistent with snow shelter collapse

**What this means:** They weren't panicked mindlessly — they executed survival procedures. Something forced them from tent, but didn't chase them. They died from exposure and secondary accidents (ravine, collapsed shelter).

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Infrasound panic (they behaved rationally after leaving)
- ❌ Continuous threat (would have killed them at tent)

**Solution space remaining:** Avalanche/wind event that threatened tent but didn't pursue

**DAMNING POWER: HIGH**

---

### CONSTRAINT 5: 2020 Research — Slab Avalanche Model

**Evidence:**
- Puzrin & Gaume (Nature, 2020) demonstrated:
  - Delayed slab avalanche possible at low slope angle
  - Triggered by cut made for tent + subsequent wind loading
  - Would produce impact forces matching observed fractures
  - Explains delay between setting camp and event
- Katabatic winds documented in area
- Wind could explain tent damage patterns

**What this means:** Known physics can produce exactly what was observed — sudden threat to tent, injuries consistent with snow impact, no external attacker.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Unknown phenomenon (known physics explains it)
- ❌ Need for exotic explanation

**Solution space remaining:** Slab avalanche + katabatic wind

**DAMNING POWER: HIGH**

---

### CONSTRAINT 6: Soviet Investigation Limitations

**Evidence:**
- Investigation closed quickly with vague conclusion
- Some files classified (normal for any death near military areas in USSR)
- Radiation found on some clothing (consistent with thorium camping lanterns of era)
- "Orange skin" on bodies (normal decomposition)

**What this means:** Soviet secrecy was procedural, not cover-up. "Mysterious" details have mundane explanations.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Military cover-up (no evidence of actual military involvement)
- ❌ Secret weapons (no weapons effects found)

**Solution space remaining:** Natural causes (avalanche + wind + exposure)

**DAMNING POWER: MODERATE**

---

## ANOMALIES

**"Why were some better dressed than others?"**
→ Those who died first gave clothing to others (documented survival behavior). Not mysterious.

**"Why didn't they return to tent?"**
→ In whiteout conditions at night, they likely couldn't find it. 1.5km in darkness and snow = effectively lost.

**"Why the missing tongue?"**
→ Body was face-down in running water for months. Soft tissue decomposition. Documented phenomenon.

**"Why the radiation?"**
→ Thorium mantles in camping lanterns. Common at the time. Measured levels were minimal.

All anomalies fit within natural explanation.

## FINAL SOLUTION SPACE

| Hypothesis | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Murder | ❌ Eliminated (Constraints 1, 2) |
| Military test | ❌ Eliminated (Constraints 2, 6) |
| Animal attack | ❌ Eliminated (Constraint 1) |
| Infrasound panic | ❌ Eliminated (Constraint 4) |
| UFO/Yeti/Unknown | ❌ Eliminated (Constraint 5) |
| **Katabatic wind + slab avalanche** | ✓ **Survives all constraints** |

## CONVICTION: 90%

One coherent natural explanation survives. 2020 research provides physical model matching all evidence.

The 10% covers: Possible undiscovered evidence that would change the picture. But 65 years of investigation hasn't produced any.

**Conclusion:** The Dyatlov group was killed by a combination of katabatic wind event and/or delayed slab avalanche, forcing evacuation from tent, followed by hypothermia and secondary injuries from terrain/shelter collapse. Tragic, but natural.
