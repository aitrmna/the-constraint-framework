February 1959. Nine experienced hikers died on Kholat Syakhl in the Ural Mountains. They cut their way out of their tent in the middle of the night, fled into -30°C temperatures without proper clothing, and scattered. Some had strange injuries. Soviet investigators concluded "compelling natural force."

For 65 years, people have proposed: secret military tests, Yeti, UFOs, infrasound-induced panic, murder.

What survives constraint stacking?

## EVIDENCE CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS

This case demonstrates how convergence analysis identifies **LOW-convergence mysteries that resolve to mundane explanations**.

### Axioms Applied

**⚠️ Boundary Conservation (WEAK)**
- Crime scene had boundaries (tent area, footprints)
- But boundaries were compromised: 3 weeks of weather, 65 years of time
- Evidence density dissipated over time
- Verdict: Boundaries existed but were porous

**✓ Irreversibility (MODERATE)**
- Footprints preserved in photos (permanent)
- Tent cuts preserved (permanent)
- Injuries documented in autopsy (permanent)
- But: Many reversible traces lost (exact weather conditions, precise sequence)
- Verdict: Some irreversible signatures, many lost

**❌ Convergence Supremacy (FAILS)**
- No independent witness streams (all dead)
- Single investigation team (Soviet, potentially biased)
- Autopsy reports (one source)
- Later analyses rely on same original evidence
- Verdict: No genuine independent verification possible

**⚠️ Gradient Navigation (WEAK)**
- Clear transition: alive → dead
- But no observation of the transition itself
- Gradient is steep but unobserved
- Verdict: Event occurred but wasn't witnessed

**❌ Bottleneck Traceability (FAILS)**
- No mandatory checkpoint for evidence to pass through
- Multiple possible causal paths (avalanche, wind, panic, etc.)
- No way to trace back definitively
- Verdict: Too many pathways, bottleneck doesn't exist

**⚠️ State-Change Amplification (MODERATE)**
- Deaths are high-energy events (should leave signatures)
- Injuries documented
- But: Weather erased many signatures over 3 weeks
- Verdict: Signatures existed but degraded

### Evidence Nodes (scored 0-10)

1. **Tent cuts from inside** — 7/10
   - Physical evidence, photographed, clear direction
   - But: Some degradation over 3 weeks before discovery

2. **Footprints to tree line** — 6/10
   - Documented in investigation
   - But: Only one investigative team, some bias possible

3. **Autopsy results (injuries)** — 6/10
   - Medical examination, documented
   - But: Soviet-era documentation, limited by 1959 forensics

4. **2020 slab avalanche simulation** — 7/10
   - Peer-reviewed, modern analysis
   - Shows mechanism is plausible
   - But: Simulation, not direct observation

5. **Katabatic wind documentation** — 5/10
   - Known phenomenon in the region
   - But: No specific measurement from that night

6. **No external tracks** — 5/10
   - Investigation photos
   - But: 3 weeks elapsed, weather could have covered tracks

### Independence Check

- Tent cuts ↔ Autopsy: Different evidence types ✓
- Footprints ↔ Injuries: Different domains ✓
- 2020 simulation ↔ Original investigation: Separated by 60 years ✓

**But:** All derive from same initial investigation. True independence is limited.

### Convergence Score

**6 nodes × 6.0 average = 36/100**

**Confidence bracket:** Weak-to-moderate (20-40 range)

**Interpretation:** Evidence quality is moderate, but lack of independent verification and time-degraded boundaries keep convergence LOW. This is exactly what we expect for historical mysteries with no witnesses and compromised crime scenes.

### What Low Convergence Means Here

**This is NOT a high-convergence case.**

Why?
- Single investigation source (Soviet team)
- 3-week delay before discovery (boundary degradation)
- No witnesses to the event
- 65 years of speculation layered on limited data

**The 2020 avalanche simulation doesn't make convergence high** — it shows a plausible mechanism, but it's a model, not independent observation.

**Critical insight:** The exotic theories (UFO, Yeti, military) have EVEN LOWER convergence (0-5 range) because they have zero supporting evidence. Natural causes wins by default, not by overwhelming proof.

**This demonstrates:** Not all "cannot eliminate" conclusions are equal. Tic Tac (62/100) vs Dyatlov (36/100) — very different confidence levels.

## CONSTRAINT STACKING ANALYSIS

**CLAIM:** What killed the Dyatlov group?

**STARTING SOLUTION SPACE:**
- Avalanche
- Katabatic wind event
- Hypothermia (simple exposure)
- Murder (by humans)
- Military weapons test
- Animal attack
- Infrasound panic
- Unknown phenomenon

---

### CONSTRAINT 1 (MOST DAMNING): They Cut Out From Inside

**Evidence:**
- Tent was cut from inside (knife cuts slope inward)
- Multiple cuts made hastily
- Footprints show orderly departure (not chaotic scramble)

**What this means:** Whatever happened, they chose to leave. Quickly. Through the tent wall rather than the entrance.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Murder by outsiders (attackers don't wait inside while victims cut their way out)
- ❌ Animal inside tent (would have torn tent, not knife cuts)
- ❌ Simple hypothermia (doesn't explain urgent exit)

**Remaining:** Avalanche, katabatic wind, military test, infrasound, unknown phenomenon

---

### CONSTRAINT 2: No External Attackers

**Evidence:**
- Only group's footprints in snow
- No other tracks for miles
- No signs of struggle with outsiders
- Nothing stolen from camp

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Murder by other humans
- ❌ Military personnel on scene
- ❌ Any external agent requiring physical presence

**Remaining:** Avalanche, katabatic wind, military test (remote), infrasound, unknown phenomenon

---

### CONSTRAINT 3: The Injuries Pattern

**Evidence:**
- Two had major chest fractures (force comparable to car crash)
- One missing tongue (post-mortem, in stream)
- Others died of hypothermia with minor injuries
- Fractures showed no external wounds (crushing force, not blunt impact)

**What this means:** Massive internal pressure without surface damage = compression force. Consistent with snow mass or fall into ravine.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Beating/attack (would show external wounds)
- ❌ Weapons (would show penetration or surface damage)
- ❌ Simple exposure (doesn't explain compression fractures)

**Remaining:** Avalanche, katabatic wind + secondary injury, unknown phenomenon

---

### CONSTRAINT 4: The Timeline and Behavior

**Evidence:**
- Fled tent urgently (cut through wall)
- Walked 1.5km downhill in orderly fashion
- Split into groups
- Some built fire, some built snow shelter
- Those in ravine had worst injuries
- Injuries consistent with snow shelter collapse

**What this means:** They weren't panicked mindlessly — they executed survival procedures. Something forced them from tent, but didn't chase them.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Infrasound panic (they behaved rationally after leaving)
- ❌ Continuous threat (would have killed them at tent)

**Remaining:** Avalanche/wind event that threatened tent but didn't pursue

---

### CONSTRAINT 5: 2020 Research — Slab Avalanche Model

**Evidence:**
- Puzrin & Gaume (Nature, 2020) demonstrated:
  - Delayed slab avalanche possible at low slope angle
  - Triggered by cut made for tent + subsequent wind loading
  - Would produce impact forces matching observed fractures
  - Explains delay between setting camp and event
- Katabatic winds documented in area

**What this means:** Known physics produces exactly what was observed.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Need for exotic explanation (known physics explains it)

**Remaining:** Slab avalanche + katabatic wind

---

### CONSTRAINT 6: Soviet Investigation Limitations

**Evidence:**
- Investigation closed quickly with vague conclusion
- Some files classified (normal for USSR)
- Radiation found on clothing (consistent with thorium camping lanterns)
- "Orange skin" (normal decomposition)

**What this means:** Soviet secrecy was procedural. "Mysterious" details have mundane explanations.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Military cover-up (no evidence of actual military involvement)
- ❌ Secret weapons (no weapons effects found)

**Remaining:** Natural causes

---

## ANOMALIES

**"Why were some better dressed than others?"**
→ Those who died first gave clothing to others. Documented survival behavior.

**"Why didn't they return to tent?"**
→ In whiteout conditions at night, they couldn't find it. 1.5km in darkness = lost.

**"Why the missing tongue?"**
→ Body face-down in running water for months. Soft tissue decomposition.

**"Why the radiation?"**
→ Thorium mantles in camping lanterns. Common at the time.

All anomalies fit within remaining solution space.

## RESULT

| Hypothesis | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Murder | ❌ Eliminated |
| Military test | ❌ Eliminated |
| Animal attack | ❌ Eliminated |
| Infrasound panic | ❌ Eliminated |
| UFO/Yeti/Unknown | ❌ Eliminated |
| **Katabatic wind + slab avalanche** | **Cannot eliminate** |

## What This Means

We are not saying "the Dyatlov group definitely died from natural causes."

We are saying: "We eliminated every exotic explanation. Natural causes — wind event forcing evacuation, followed by exposure and secondary injuries — is the only hypothesis that survives the constraints."

Tragic, but mundane.
