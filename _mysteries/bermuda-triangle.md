The Bermuda Triangle (Miami, Bermuda, Puerto Rico) is supposedly responsible for mysterious disappearances of ships and aircraft. Compasses spin. Electronics fail. Vessels vanish.

Famous legend. But is there actually an anomaly?

**The test:** What must be true if an anomaly exists? Does reality match?

---

## Competing Hypotheses

1. Anomalous disappearances (unknown force)
2. Normal hazards (dangerous but explainable)
3. Statistical artifact (no real anomaly at all)

---

## H1: Anomalous Disappearances

**What must be true:**
- Disappearance RATE higher than comparable areas
- Insurance companies would notice (money at stake)
- Coast Guard would document pattern
- Famous cases lack mundane explanations
- Comparison areas wouldn't show similar rates

**Reality check:**

**Higher rate?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Rate not elevated compared to other high-traffic areas
- Absolute numbers high because traffic volume high
- Need rate, not raw count

**Insurance notices?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Lloyd's of London shows no elevated risk
- Insurance rates not higher than comparable regions
- If ships vanished anomalously, insurers MUST notice (their money depends on it)
- **This is the decisive test**: Cannot have mysterious disappearances without affecting insurance

**Coast Guard documents?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- US Coast Guard official position: No anomaly
- "The Coast Guard does not recognize the existence of the so-called Bermuda Triangle as a geographic area of specific hazard"
- Agency responsible for search/rescue sees nothing unusual

**Famous cases unexplainable?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Flight 19 (1945): Leader got lost, refused standard procedures, ran out of fuel. Search plane (PBM Mariner) exploded - witnessed, debris found.
- USS Cyclops (1918): Overloaded with ore, structural issues, inexperienced captain, bad seas, likely capsized
- SS Marine Sulphur Queen (1963): Known structural problems, carrying volatile cargo, debris later found
- Famous cases have mundane explanations when investigated

**Other areas different?** → ✗ FAIL
- Comparable high-traffic areas have similar incident rates
- "Devil's Sea" near Japan - same legend, same debunking
- No ocean region has zero accidents

**Score:** 0/5 passes, 4 critical + 1 fail
Calculation: 0% × (1 - 0.66) = **0%**

**Result:** Dead. Multiple critical failures. No anomaly exists.

## H2: Normal Hazards

**What must be true:**
- Known environmental hazards present
- Incidents explainable by these hazards
- Rate elevated but within normal for hazardous areas

**Reality check:**

**Known hazards?** → ✓ PASS
- Gulf Stream (strong current disperses debris)
- Sudden storms common
- Shallow waters + deep trenches
- Real but normal ocean hazards

**Incidents explainable?** → ✓ PASS
- Weather, navigational errors, mechanical failures
- All documented cases have explanations

**Rate elevated?** → ✗ FAIL
- Rate NOT elevated
- This hypothesis predicts higher rate - doesn't exist

**Score:** 2/3 passes, 1 fail
**Result:** Hazards exist but don't create elevated disappearance rate.

---

## H3: Statistical Artifact (No Anomaly)

**What must be true:**
- High traffic volume explains high absolute numbers
- Rate not elevated when accounting for traffic
- Insurance sees no anomaly
- Legend created by selective reporting

**Reality check:**

**High traffic explains numbers?** → ✓ PASS
- One of world's busiest shipping lanes
- Major air traffic Florida/Caribbean
- More traffic = more incidents (absolute), even if rate normal

**Rate normal?** → ✓ PASS
- When accounting for traffic, rate is normal
- Not statistically different from other areas

**Insurance sees nothing?** → ✓ PASS
- Lloyd's shows no elevated risk
- Rates not adjusted
- Financial data confirms no anomaly

**Legend manufactured?** → ✓ PASS
- Term "Bermuda Triangle" invented 1964 magazine article
- Charles Berlitz book (1974) popularized legend
- Selective reporting: cases with explanations presented as "mysterious"
- Incidents outside triangle sometimes attributed to it
- Cherry-picked from large dataset

**Score:** 4/4 passes
Calculation: 100% × (1 - 0) = **100%**

**Result:** Perfect fit. This is the explanation.

---

## Comparison

| Hypothesis | Score | Critical Failures |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| **Statistical artifact** | **100%** | **0** |
| Normal hazards | ~50% | 0 |
| Anomalous disappearances | 0% | 4 |

**Winner:** Statistical artifact. No anomaly exists.

## The Decisive Evidence

**Lloyd's of London doesn't charge more to insure ships in the Bermuda Triangle.**

This single fact kills the anomaly hypothesis. You cannot have mysterious disappearances without affecting insurance mathematics.

If ships vanished at elevated rates, insurers would lose money. They would raise rates. They don't.

**Bottleneck test passed: No elevated signal where signal MUST exist.**

---

## What This Means

Ships and planes have been lost in the Bermuda Triangle.

Ships and planes are lost everywhere.

The **rate** in the Triangle is not higher than comparable high-traffic regions.

**The mystery was created by:**
- Selective reporting (showing incidents, hiding explanations)
- Sensationalized books
- Cherry-picking from large dataset
- Ignoring traffic volume

**Sometimes the mystery IS the myth.** The Bermuda Triangle is one of them.

---

**Confidence:** Very high (100% vs 0%)
**Status:** Debunked - no anomaly exists
**Value:** Shows framework debunks false mysteries, not just exotic claims
