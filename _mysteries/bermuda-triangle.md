The Bermuda Triangle — roughly bounded by Miami, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico — is supposedly responsible for the mysterious disappearance of ships and aircraft. Compasses spin. Electronics fail. Vessels vanish without trace.

The legend is famous. But is there actually an anomaly?

---

## CONSTRAINT STACKING ANALYSIS

**CLAIM:** The Bermuda Triangle has an anomalously high rate of mysterious disappearances.

**STARTING SOLUTION SPACE:**
- Real anomaly (unknown force causing disappearances)
- Elevated but explainable (dangerous waters, normal causes)
- No anomaly at all (statistical artifact / selection bias)

### CONSTRAINT 1 (MOST DAMNING): Lloyd's of London Insurance Data

**Evidence:**
- Lloyd's of London insures global shipping
- Their data shows no elevated risk in the Bermuda Triangle
- Insurance rates for the region are not higher than comparable areas
- If ships were vanishing anomalously, insurers would notice — their money depends on it

**What this means:** The people with the most financial incentive to track maritime risk don't see an anomaly.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Elevated disappearance rate (insurers would price it in)

**Remaining:** No anomaly, or an anomaly insurers somehow miss

---

### CONSTRAINT 2: US Coast Guard Position

**Evidence:**
- USCG reviewed Bermuda Triangle claims
- Official position: "The Coast Guard does not recognize the existence of the so-called Bermuda Triangle as a geographic area of specific hazard to ships or planes"
- Number of incidents not statistically significant given traffic volume

**What this means:** The agency responsible for search and rescue in the area sees nothing unusual.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Real anomaly (USCG would know)

**Remaining:** No anomaly

---

### CONSTRAINT 3: Traffic Volume

**Evidence:**
- Bermuda Triangle is one of the most heavily traveled regions in the world
- Major shipping lanes between Americas, Europe, Caribbean
- Heavy air traffic (Florida, Caribbean destinations)
- High volume = more incidents in absolute numbers, even if rate is normal

**What this means:** More traffic means more accidents. You need to look at RATE, not raw count.

**For anomaly to exist:**
- Disappearance RATE must be higher than comparable high-traffic areas

**Assessment:** Rate is not elevated. Raw numbers are high because traffic is high.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Raw disappearance numbers as evidence (explained by traffic)

**Remaining:** No anomaly

### CONSTRAINT 4: The "Famous" Cases — Examined

**Flight 19 (1945):**
- Five TBM Avengers vanished during training
- "Mystery": Compasses failed, couldn't find way back
- Reality: Leader Lt. Taylor was known to get lost, refused to follow standard procedures, ran out of fuel over open ocean
- Search plane that "vanished" (PBM Mariner) exploded — witnessed by ship, debris found

**USS Cyclops (1918):**
- Collier ship vanished with 309 crew
- "Mystery": No distress call, no wreckage
- Reality: Overloaded with heavy ore, had structural issues, captain had no Navy training, sea conditions were bad, likely capsized rapidly

**SS Marine Sulphur Queen (1963):**
- Tanker vanished with 39 crew
- "Mystery": No trace
- Reality: Ship had known structural problems, was carrying molten sulphur (fire risk), Coast Guard later found debris

**What this means:** The famous cases have mundane explanations when investigated. The "mystery" often comes from incomplete reporting.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Famous cases as evidence (explanations exist)

**Remaining:** No anomaly

---

### CONSTRAINT 5: Environmental Factors (Real but Normal)

**Evidence:**
- Gulf Stream: Strong current can rapidly disperse debris
- Weather: Sudden storms common in Caribbean
- Shallow waters + deep trenches: Varied sea floor
- Methane hydrates: Occasionally proposed, but no documented ship sinkings from this

**What this means:** The region has real hazards — but these are known, normal ocean hazards, not mysterious forces.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Need for unknown explanation (known hazards suffice)

---

### CONSTRAINT 6: Publication Bias / Legend Creation

**Evidence:**
- Term "Bermuda Triangle" invented in 1964 magazine article
- Books by Charles Berlitz (1974) popularized the legend
- Berlitz and others selectively reported cases, omitted explanations
- Incidents outside the triangle sometimes attributed to it
- Cases with known explanations presented as "mysterious"

**What this means:** The mystery was manufactured by selective reporting.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Bermuda Triangle as real phenomenon (it's a media creation)

---

### CONSTRAINT 7: Comparison to Similar Waters

**Evidence:**
- Comparable high-traffic ocean areas have similar incident rates
- "Devil's Sea" near Japan — same legend, same debunking
- No ocean region has zero accidents
- Bermuda Triangle doesn't stand out statistically

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Unique regional anomaly (other areas are similar)

---

## RESULT

| Hypothesis | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Unknown force causing disappearances | ❌ Eliminated |
| Elevated but natural hazards | ❌ Eliminated (rate not elevated) |
| **Statistical artifact / selection bias** | **Cannot eliminate — this is the explanation** |

---

## What This Means

We are not saying "nothing ever disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle."

We are saying: "Ships and planes have been lost in the Bermuda Triangle. Ships and planes are lost everywhere. The rate of loss in the Triangle is not higher than comparable high-traffic regions. The 'mystery' was created by selective reporting, sensationalized books, and the omission of known explanations for famous cases."

Lloyd's doesn't charge more to insure it. The Coast Guard doesn't recognize it. The statistics don't support it.

**Sometimes the mystery IS the myth.** The Bermuda Triangle is one of them.

This is what debunking looks like in constraint stacking.
