November 1989 to April 1990. Belgium's famous UFO wave: 13,500+ witnesses, F-16 radar locks showing 40g maneuvers, official investigation. One of the most cited cases ever.

**Then you check the evidence carefully.**

**The test:** What must be true if extraordinary craft were operating? Does reality match?

---

## Competing Hypotheses

1. Extraordinary craft (advanced/non-human technology)
2. Misidentification + media amplification

---

## H1: Extraordinary Craft

**What must be true:**
- F-16 radar tracked real external objects
- Pilots visually confirmed during radar locks
- Photos/videos exist (thousands of witnesses over 5 months)
- Contemporary media coverage preserved
- Reports concentrated on peak sighting dates

**Reality check:**

**Radar tracked objects?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Investigation revealed F-16s locked onto *each other*
- Two F-16s tracking each other, not external object
- Foundation evidence collapses

**Visual confirmation?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Pilots saw *nothing* during radar locks
- No visual confirmation of claimed 40g maneuvers
- If objects were there, trained pilots would see them

**Photos/videos exist?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- ONE photo (admitted hoax in 2011)
- Essentially no video ever found
- 1989-1990: camcorders widespread, yet no footage
- Thousands of witnesses over 5 months = should have multiple clear images

**Media coverage preserved?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- Claims of intensive coverage
- Very little contemporary footage in archives
- Not supported by preserved media

**Reports on sighting dates?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Mass sighting claimed for March 30-31
- ZERO official reports filed on those dates
- 143 reports came in over next 2 weeks AFTER media requested them
- Classic pattern: reports follow publicity, not sightings

**Score:** 0/5 passes, 4 critical + 1 major fails
Calculation: 0% × (1 - 0.66) = **0%**

**Result:** Dead. Multiple critical failures. Foundation evidence (radar) collapses.

---

## H2: Misidentification + Media Amplification

**What must be true:**
- F-16 radar locks explainable by error
- No visual confirmation during radar events
- Limited photographic evidence (misidentifications don't photograph well)
- Reports follow media coverage (social contagion)
- Various mundane sources (helicopters, planes, stars)

**Reality check:**

**Radar explainable?** → ✓ PASS
- F-16s locked onto each other (confirmed)
- Technical error, not anomalous objects

**No visual confirmation?** → ✓ PASS
- Pilots saw nothing during radar events
- Consistent with no actual objects performing maneuvers

**Limited photos?** → ✓ PASS
- One hoax photo only
- No genuine imagery
- Consistent with misidentifications

**Reports follow coverage?** → ✓ PASS
- Zero reports on claimed date
- 143 reports in 2 weeks after media solicitation
- Social contagion pattern

**Various sources?** → ✓ PASS
- Descriptions vary when examined
- Consistent with mixed stimuli (helicopters, planes, stars)

**Score:** 5/5 passes, 0 fails
Calculation: 100% × (1 - 0) = **100%**

**Result:** Perfect fit. All predictions pass.

## Comparison

| Hypothesis | Score | Critical Failures |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| **Misidentification** | **100%** | **0** |
| Extraordinary craft | 0% | 4 |

**Advantage:** Infinite (100% vs 0%)

## What Actually Happened

1. Various mundane objects misidentified (helicopters, planes, stars)
2. Media coverage created awareness and solicited reports
3. Reports came AFTER publicity (social contagion)
4. F-16 incident: Radar confusion (locked onto each other)
5. One hoax photo created (admitted 2011)
6. Story grew in retelling
7. No extraordinary evidence survived scrutiny

**Classic pattern:**
- Ambiguous stimuli + media attention = wave of reports
- Reports cluster after publicity, not during events
- No photos/video despite widespread cameras
- Technical data misinterpreted
- Famous photo = hoax

---

## Why This Case Matters

**The Belgian Wave shows the framework working in reverse: it DEBUNKS.**

**Compare to Tic Tac:**

**Belgian Wave:**
- Radar data failed (F-16s tracked each other)
- No visual confirmation during key events
- No photographic evidence (1 hoax only)
- Reports followed publicity
- 5 critical failures → 0%

**Tic Tac:**
- Multiple independent sensors confirmed
- Visual confirmation by trained observers
- Pentagon-verified footage
- Reports immediate, not publicity-driven
- Zero critical failures → 78%

**The difference is stark.**

---

## Red Flags (Pattern Recognition)

When you see these, skepticism warranted:
- Reports come AFTER media coverage, not during events
- No photos/videos despite long duration and many witnesses
- Technical data reinterpreted upon scrutiny
- Famous photo turns out to be hoax
- No visual confirmation of claimed performance

**Belgian Wave has all five red flags.**

---

## The Lesson

The framework doesn't favor exotic conclusions. It follows evidence.

When evidence collapses under scrutiny → hypothesis dies.
When evidence survives under scrutiny → hypothesis survives.

**Belgian Wave: weak case revealed**
**Tic Tac: strong case confirmed**

The framework differentiates correctly.

---

**Confidence:** Very high (100% vs 0%)
**Status:** Case debunked through systematic testing
**Value:** Calibration — proves framework isn't biased toward exotic explanations
