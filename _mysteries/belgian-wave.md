result: Cannot eliminate — non-human technology

November 1989 to April 1990. Belgium experienced a wave of sightings — large triangular craft with lights, seen by thousands of witnesses including police officers. The Belgian Air Force scrambled F-16s. They got radar locks. The objects outmaneuvered them. The Belgian government investigated openly and admitted they couldn't explain it.

This is what government transparency on UAP looks like.

## CONSTRAINT STACKING ANALYSIS

**CLAIM:** What were the Belgian triangle objects?

**STARTING SOLUTION SPACE:**
- Mass hysteria / misidentification
- Helicopters
- Stealth aircraft (F-117, B-2)
- Experimental aircraft
- Elaborate hoax
- Non-human technology

---

### CONSTRAINT 1 (MOST DAMNING): F-16 Radar Locks + Performance Data

**Evidence:**
- Night of March 30-31, 1990: Two F-16s scrambled
- Pilots achieved radar lock multiple times
- Onboard computers recorded object performance:
  - Descended from 10,000 ft to 500 ft in 5 seconds (1,900 ft/sec = ~1,300 mph vertical)
  - Accelerated from 280 km/h to 1,800 km/h (1,120 mph) in seconds
  - G-forces calculated at 40g
- Objects broke radar lock by accelerating beyond F-16 tracking capability
- This happened multiple times during the intercept

**What this means:** Fighter jet computers recorded performance data. This isn't witness testimony — it's instrumentation.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Helicopter (can't do 40g or 1,800 km/h)
- ❌ F-117 Stealth Fighter (max speed ~680 mph, can't hover)
- ❌ B-2 Bomber (max speed ~630 mph, can't hover or do 40g)
- ❌ Any known 1990 aircraft (nothing does 40g)
- ❌ Mass hysteria (radar doesn't have hysteria)

**Remaining:** Unknown technology far beyond 1990 state of the art

---

### CONSTRAINT 2: Thousands of Witnesses Over Months

**Evidence:**
- Wave began November 29, 1989
- Continued through April 1990
- Over 13,500 witnesses filed reports
- Witnesses included police officers (multiple), military personnel, pilots
- Consistent descriptions: Large triangle, three lights at corners, sometimes central red light, silent or low hum, slow-moving but capable of rapid acceleration

**What this means:** Not a single night's excitement. Months of consistent sightings across a country.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ One-time misidentification (months of sightings)
- ❌ Small group delusion (13,500+ witnesses)
- ❌ Inconsistent reports (descriptions remarkably consistent)

**Remaining:** Persistent presence of similar objects over extended period

---

### CONSTRAINT 3: Police Witnesses — First Night

**Evidence:**
- November 29, 1989: Two police officers (Heinrich Nicoll and Hubert von Montigny) observed triangular object for over an hour
- Object had three powerful lights, moved slowly and silently
- Officers contacted other patrols — multiple police teams saw it
- Object eventually accelerated and departed rapidly
- Official police reports filed

**What this means:** Trained observers with nothing to gain from false reports.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Untrained observer error (police officers)
- ❌ Brief glimpse (over an hour observation)

**Remaining:** Something that trained personnel observed extensively

---

### CONSTRAINT 4: Belgian Air Force Official Position

**Evidence:**
- Major General Wilfried De Brouwer led Air Force investigation
- Air Force held press conference presenting radar data
- De Brouwer publicly stated: "The Air Force has arrived at the conclusion that a number of anomalous phenomena have been produced within Belgian airspace"
- Admitted they could not explain the objects
- Did NOT claim secret aircraft, weather, or hysteria
- Cooperated openly with civilian investigators (SOBEPS)

**What this means:** Military investigated, couldn't explain it, admitted so publicly. No cover-up attempted.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Easy conventional explanation (military couldn't find one)
- ❌ Government cover-up (they were transparent)
- ❌ Misidentified military assets (Air Force would know their own assets)

**Remaining:** Genuinely unknown to Belgian military

---

### CONSTRAINT 5: Not US Stealth Aircraft

**Evidence:**
- F-117 was operational but based in Nevada, classified, not flying over Belgium
- B-2 wasn't operational until 1993
- Stealth aircraft don't hover
- Stealth aircraft don't do 40g maneuvers
- Stealth aircraft aren't silent at low altitude
- US had no reason to fly secret aircraft repeatedly over NATO ally without coordination
- Belgian Air Force checked — not American

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ F-117 Nighthawk (wrong performance, wrong continent)
- ❌ B-2 Spirit (not operational yet)
- ❌ Any US stealth program (doesn't match capabilities)

**Remaining:** Not known US technology

---

### CONSTRAINT 6: Not Soviet

**Evidence:**
- 1989-1990: Soviet Union was collapsing
- Soviets had no stealth capability
- No Soviet aircraft could hover, then accelerate to 1,800 km/h
- Flying repeatedly over NATO country would be act of war
- No diplomatic incident occurred

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Soviet secret aircraft (no capability, no motive, would cause international crisis)

**Remaining:** Not Soviet technology

---

### CONSTRAINT 7: Ground Observation + Airborne Radar Correlation

**Evidence:**
- Multiple nights had both ground witnesses AND radar contacts
- March 30-31: Ground observers reported triangle, F-16s detected and tracked on radar, visual and radar correlated
- Objects seen from ground behaved consistently with radar tracks

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Radar-only glitch (ground witnesses confirmed)
- ❌ Visual-only illusion (radar confirmed)

**Remaining:** Physical objects detected by multiple means

---

## ANOMALIES

**"The famous photo was a hoax"**
→ Yes. One widely circulated photo (the "Petit-Rechain" photo) was admitted as a hoax in 2011. However: The photo was never the primary evidence. The radar data, F-16 intercepts, thousands of witnesses, and police reports are independent of any photograph. One hoax photo doesn't invalidate an entire wave.

**"Why Belgium?"**
→ Unknown. Belgium hosts NATO headquarters. Dense population means more witnesses. Beyond that, unclear why this location.

**"Why triangles?"**
→ Unknown. Triangular craft are reported globally. If these are constructed vehicles, triangle might be an efficient or preferred design.

All anomalies fit within remaining solution space.

## What This Means

We are not saying "alien triangles flew over Belgium."

We are saying: "F-16 radar recorded objects performing 40g maneuvers. Thousands of witnesses over months reported consistent triangle craft. The Belgian Air Force investigated openly and admitted they couldn't explain it. Neither US stealth aircraft nor any known technology matches the performance data. Non-human technology cannot be eliminated."

The Belgian government did what others won't: they told the truth about what they didn't know.
