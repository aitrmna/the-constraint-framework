result: Evidence collapses - 5 critical failures
category: uap
---

November 1989 to April 1990. Belgium experienced a wave of reported UFO sightings — large triangular craft with lights. The story: 13,500+ witnesses, F-16 radar locks showing 40g maneuvers, official Belgian Air Force investigation. One of the most famous UFO cases ever.

**Then you check the evidence carefully.**

## THE MYSTERY

**Core Question:** Were extraordinary craft operating over Belgium in 1989-1990?

**The Claims:**
- 13,500+ witnesses saw triangular craft
- F-16s got radar locks, recorded 40g maneuvers
- Belgian Air Force confirmed anomalous objects
- Massive wave lasting 5 months
- Government transparency and investigation

**Let's test these claims.**

## COMPETING HYPOTHESES

**H1: Extraordinary Craft (Non-Human Tech)**
- Advanced technology performed extreme maneuvers
- Thousands witnessed genuine anomalous objects
- F-16 data confirms extraordinary performance

**H2: Misidentification + Media Amplification**
- Various mundane objects misidentified
- Media coverage created reporting wave
- Radar data misinterpreted or faulty
- Social contagion produced consistent reports

---

## PREDICTIONS & TESTING

### H1: Extraordinary Craft

**Predictions:**

1. **F-16 radar tracked real external objects** → ✗ **CRITICAL FAIL**
   - Prediction: Radar locked onto physical craft
   - Observation: Investigation revealed F-16 radars locked onto each other (two F-16s tracking each other, not external object)
   - This is the foundation evidence - it collapses

2. **Visual confirmation during radar locks** → ✗ **CRITICAL FAIL**
   - Prediction: Pilots would see objects performing 40g maneuvers
   - Observation: Pilots saw nothing during the radar "locks"
   - No visual confirmation of claimed extreme performance

3. **Photographic/video evidence exists** → ✗ **CRITICAL FAIL**
   - Prediction: With thousands of witnesses over 5 months, multiple photos/videos
   - Observation: ONE famous photo (admitted hoax in 2011), essentially no video ever found
   - In 1989-1990, camcorders were widespread - yet no documented footage

4. **Contemporary media coverage preserved** → ✗ **MAJOR FAIL**
   - Prediction: Intensive coverage would be archived, findable online
   - Observation: Very little contemporary footage exists in archives
   - Claims of massive coverage not supported by preserved media

5. **Reports concentrated on peak sighting date** → ✗ **CRITICAL FAIL**
   - Prediction: Mass sighting March 30-31 would produce reports on those dates
   - Observation: ZERO official reports filed on March 30-31
   - 143 reports came in over next 2 weeks AFTER media requested them
   - Classic pattern: Reports follow publicity, not sightings

**Score:** 0/5 = 0%
**Severity:** 4 critical + 1 major = (0.6 + 0.6 + 0.6 + 0.6 + 0.3) / 5 = 0.66
**Overall Fit:** 0% × (1 - 0.66) = **0%**

### H2: Misidentification + Media Amplification

**Predictions:**

1. **F-16 radar locks explainable** → ✓ **PASS**
   - Prediction: Technical error or known phenomenon
   - Observation: Radars locked onto each other (confirmed)

2. **No visual confirmation during "extreme" events** → ✓ **PASS**
   - Prediction: If objects weren't performing as claimed, pilots wouldn't see them
   - Observation: Pilots saw nothing during radar events

3. **Limited photographic evidence** → ✓ **PASS**
   - Prediction: Misidentifications don't photograph well
   - Observation: One hoax photo, no genuine imagery found

4. **Reports follow media coverage** → ✓ **PASS**
   - Prediction: Social contagion produces reports after publicity
   - Observation: 143 reports in 2 weeks after media solicitation, zero on actual date

5. **Various mundane sources** → ✓ **PASS**
   - Prediction: Different witnesses seeing different things (helicopters, planes, stars)
   - Observation: Descriptions vary when examined closely, consistent with mixed stimuli

**Score:** 5/5 = 100%
**Severity:** 0 failures
**Overall Fit:** 100%

## COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

| Hypothesis | Overall Fit | Critical Failures |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Misidentification + Media** | **100%** | 0 |
| Extraordinary Craft | 0% | 4 |

**Advantage Ratio:** Infinite (100% vs 0%)

**Interpretation:** The evidence for extraordinary craft collapses completely when examined. This is a case where the framework DEBUNKS.

## CONSTRAINT STACKING

**CONSTRAINT 1: F-16 Radar Performance Data**
- **Claim:** Radars recorded 40g maneuvers by external object
- **Reality:** Investigation showed F-16s locked onto each other
- **Result:** Foundation evidence collapses
- **CRITICAL FAILURE**

**CONSTRAINT 2: Visual Confirmation**
- **Claim:** Objects performed extreme maneuvers
- **Reality:** Pilots saw nothing during radar locks
- **Result:** No confirmation of claimed performance
- **CRITICAL FAILURE**

**CONSTRAINT 3: Photographic Evidence**
- **Claim:** Thousands witnessed over 5 months
- **Reality:** ONE photo (admitted hoax), essentially no video found
- **Result:** Missing expected documentation
- **CRITICAL FAILURE**

**CONSTRAINT 4: Report Timing**
- **Claim:** Mass sighting occurred March 30-31
- **Reality:** ZERO reports on those dates, 143 reports over next 2 weeks after media request
- **Result:** Reports followed publicity, not sightings
- **CRITICAL FAILURE**

**CONSTRAINT 5: Media Coverage**
- **Claim:** Intensive media coverage of extraordinary events
- **Reality:** Very little contemporary footage findable in archives
- **Result:** Coverage claims not supported by preserved evidence
- **MAJOR FAILURE**

**All 5 constraints fail. Case collapses.**

## THE PATTERN REVEALED

**What actually happened:**

1. Various mundane objects were misidentified (helicopters, planes, stars)
2. Media coverage created awareness and solicited reports
3. Reports came in AFTER publicity (social contagion)
4. F-16 incident: Radar confusion (locked onto each other)
5. Someone created one hoax photo (admitted 2011)
6. Story grew in retelling
7. No actual extraordinary evidence survived scrutiny

**Classic pattern:**
- Ambiguous stimuli + media attention = wave of reports
- Reports cluster after publicity, not during claimed events
- No photographic/video evidence despite widespread availability of cameras
- Technical data (radar) misinterpreted or faulty
- Famous photo turns out to be hoax

---

## WHAT THIS CASE TEACHES

**The Belgian UFO Wave is important because it shows the framework working in reverse.**

This is a DEBUNKING case.

**It demonstrates:**
1. Framework doesn't favor exotic conclusions
2. Careful examination collapses weak cases
3. Famous cases can have weak evidence
4. Media amplification creates false patterns
5. Even "official investigations" can be based on flawed data

**Compare to Tic Tac:**
- Tic Tac: Multiple independent sensors all confirmed, visual confirmation, no failed predictions
- Belgian Wave: Foundation evidence (radar) fails, no visual confirmation during key events, 5 critical failures

**The difference is stark.**

---

## LESSONS FOR OTHER CASES

**Red flags that appeared here:**
- Reports come AFTER media coverage, not during events
- No photographic/video evidence despite long duration and many witnesses
- Technical data reinterpreted upon scrutiny
- Famous photo turns out to be hoax
- No visual confirmation of claimed extreme performance

**When you see these patterns, skepticism is warranted.**

---

## CONCLUSION

**The Belgian UFO Wave:**
- Not supported by evidence when examined carefully
- Classic case of social contagion + misidentification
- Framework reveals it as weak case
- Important as control/calibration for the method

**Confidence:** Very high (100% vs 0%)

**What it proves:** The framework DEBUNKS when evidence fails. This matters. It shows the method isn't biased toward exotic conclusions.

**When Tic Tac survives with 60% fit and Belgian Wave collapses with 0% fit, the framework is working correctly.**
