December 4, 1872. The Dei Gratia found the Mary Celeste drifting 400 miles east of the Azores. The ship was seaworthy, cargo intact.

No crew. Captain Briggs, his wife, two-year-old daughter, and seven crew members vanished. Lifeboat gone.

**The test:** What must be true for each explanation? Does reality match?

---

## Competing Hypotheses

1. Piracy
2. Mutiny
3. Murder/fraud by Dei Gratia crew
4. Waterspout swept them overboard
5. Crew abandoned ship due to perceived danger

---

## H1: Piracy

**What must be true:**
- Pirates would take cargo
- Money and valuables stolen
- Ship likely damaged or scuttled

**Reality check:**

**Cargo taken?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- 1,701 barrels of alcohol untouched
- Ship was valuable - not scuttled
- Pirates take cargo - this is the point

**Money stolen?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Captain's chest with money present
- Crew personal belongings present

**Score:** 0/2 passes, 2 critical fails
**Result:** Dead. Pirates don't leave cargo and money.

---

## H2: Mutiny

**What must be true:**
- Mutineers would take money/goods
- Evidence of violence
- Mutiny motivated by profit or grievance

**Reality check:**

**Would take valuables?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Money left behind
- Cargo left behind
- No profit motive served

**Evidence of violence?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- No blood (later claims debunked)
- No weapon damage
- No signs of struggle

**Score:** 0/2 passes, 2 critical fails
**Result:** Dead. No violence, no theft.

---

## H3: Murder/Fraud by Dei Gratia

**What must be true:**
- Signs of violence
- Suspicion from investigation
- Financial motive

**Reality check:**

**Signs of violence?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- No blood found
- No struggle
- Ship intact

**Investigation suspicious?** → ✗ FAIL
- Vice-Admiralty Court investigated thoroughly
- Considered fraud - rejected
- No charges filed
- Dei Gratia crew paid salvage (reduced due to suspicions, but paid)

**Score:** 0/2 passes, 1 critical + 1 fail
**Result:** Dead. Investigated and rejected.

---

## H4: Waterspout Swept Them Overboard

**What must be true:**
- Instant event (no time to launch boat)
- Lifeboat still aboard
- Damage from wave/spout

**Reality check:**

**Instant event?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Lifeboat was gone
- Launching lifeboat takes time and effort
- They chose to leave

**Lifeboat aboard?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Ship's yawl (lifeboat) missing
- Rope trailing from ship (possibly towing lifeboat)
- Deliberate launch, not swept away

**Score:** 0/2 passes, 2 critical fails
**Result:** Dead. Lifeboat gone = deliberate departure.

---

## H5: Abandoned Due to Perceived Danger

**What must be true:**
- Deliberate launch of lifeboat
- Ship functional but crew feared something
- No theft (emergency evacuation)
- Plausible danger source
- Crew planned to wait nearby (explains rope)
- Separation from ship fatal (explains no survivors)

**Reality check:**

**Deliberate launch?** → ✓ PASS
- Lifeboat missing
- Takes time to launch
- Intentional departure

**Ship functional?** → ✓ PASS
- Dei Gratia sailed it to Gibraltar successfully
- 3.5 feet water in hold but pumps working
- Hull intact, sails damaged but functional
- They abandoned a seaworthy ship

**No theft?** → ✓ PASS
- Cargo intact
- Money present
- Personal belongings present
- Emergency mindset, not criminal

**Plausible danger?** → ✓ PASS
- 1,701 barrels commercial alcohol aboard
- Nine barrels found empty
- Alcohol expands with temperature, releases fumes
- Captain may have feared explosion
- Fumes in enclosed hold can seem explosive
- No actual explosion occurred (fear was wrong)

**Planned to wait nearby?** → ✓ PASS
- Trailing rope suggests towed lifeboat
- Wouldn't permanently abandon valuable ship
- Plan: wait at safe distance, return when safe

**Fatal separation?** → ✓ PASS
- Rope broke or lifeboat swamped
- Ship under partial sail outpaced small boat
- Open Atlantic in December
- Small lifeboat = death within days
- No search in right area fast enough

**Score:** 6/6 passes
Calculation: 100% × (1 - 0) = **100%**

## Comparison

| Hypothesis | Score | Critical Failures |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| **Abandoned (perceived danger)** | **100%** | **0** |
| Piracy | 0% | 2 |
| Mutiny | 0% | 2 |
| Murder/fraud | 0% | 1 |
| Waterspout | 0% | 2 |

**Winner:** Abandonment by elimination. Only hypothesis with zero failures.

## What Likely Happened

1. Temperature changes caused alcohol to off-gas
2. Captain opened hatch, saw/smelled alarming fumes
3. With wife and baby aboard, prioritized caution
4. Ordered crew into lifeboat
5. Tied rope to ship, planned to wait at safe distance
6. Rope broke or lifeboat swamped
7. Ship sailed on under partial sail
8. Crew died in open Atlantic in small boat

**The explosion never happened. The caution was reasonable. The outcome was tragic.**

---

**Not a mystery. A tragedy of reasonable caution gone wrong.**

**Confidence:** High (only explanation without critical failures)
**Status:** Deliberate abandonment due to perceived (but incorrect) danger
