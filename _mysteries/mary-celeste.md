December 4, 1872. The brigantine Dei Gratia spotted the Mary Celeste drifting in the Atlantic, about 400 miles east of the Azores. The ship was seaworthy, sails partially set, cargo intact.

No one was aboard. The lifeboat was gone. The crew of ten — including Captain Briggs, his wife, and two-year-old daughter — were never seen again.

## CONSTRAINT STACKING ANALYSIS

**CLAIM:** What happened to the crew of the Mary Celeste?

**STARTING SOLUTION SPACE:**
- Piracy
- Mutiny
- Murder by Dei Gratia crew (insurance fraud)
- Waterspout / rogue wave swept them overboard
- Alcohol fumes explosion fear
- Seaquake
- Supernatural/unknown

---

### CONSTRAINT 1 (MOST DAMNING): The Lifeboat Was Gone

**Evidence:**
- Ship's yawl (lifeboat) was missing
- Launching a lifeboat is deliberate — takes time and effort
- Rope trailing from ship (possibly used to tow lifeboat)

**What this means:** The crew chose to leave. They weren't swept overboard or taken. They got in the lifeboat intentionally.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Swept overboard by wave/waterspout (lifeboat wouldn't also be gone)
- ❌ Instantaneous catastrophe (they had time to launch boat)
- ❌ Supernatural vanishing (they left by normal means)

**Remaining:** Piracy, mutiny, fraud, deliberate abandonment for perceived danger

---

### CONSTRAINT 2: Cargo and Valuables Intact

**Evidence:**
- 1,701 barrels of commercial alcohol — untouched
- Captain's chest with money — present
- Crew's personal belongings — present
- No cargo missing
- Ship was valuable and seaworthy

**What this means:** Whoever left wasn't motivated by theft.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Piracy (pirates take cargo and valuables)
- ❌ Mutiny for profit (mutineers would take money/goods)

**Remaining:** Fraud, abandonment for perceived danger

---

### CONSTRAINT 3: No Signs of Violence

**Evidence:**
- No blood found (later claims of blood were debunked)
- No damage from weapons
- No signs of struggle
- Ship structurally sound

**What this means:** Nobody was killed aboard.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Murder by Dei Gratia crew (no evidence of violence)
- ❌ Violent mutiny (no struggle)

**Remaining:** Deliberate abandonment for perceived danger

---

### CONSTRAINT 4: Ship Was Seaworthy

**Evidence:**
- Dei Gratia crew sailed Mary Celeste to Gibraltar — no major problems
- Some water in hold (3.5 feet) but pumps operational
- Hull intact
- Sails damaged but functional

**What this means:** Whatever the crew feared, it wasn't the ship sinking immediately. They abandoned a functional vessel.

**For abandonment to make sense:**
- They perceived imminent danger that turned out to be wrong, OR
- They planned to stay attached by rope and something went wrong

**Remaining:** Perceived danger causing premature abandonment

---

### CONSTRAINT 5: The Alcohol Cargo

**Evidence:**
- 1,701 barrels of commercial alcohol
- Nine barrels later found empty
- Alcohol expands with temperature changes, can release fumes
- Fumes in enclosed hold could seem explosive
- No actual explosion occurred

**The theory:**
- Temperature changes caused alcohol to off-gas
- Captain opened hatch, saw/smelled fumes
- Feared imminent explosion
- Ordered crew into lifeboat, tied rope to ship to wait at safe distance
- Rope broke or lifeboat swamped
- Ship sailed on without them

**Assessment:**
- Explains why they'd abandon seaworthy ship
- Explains why they'd take lifeboat but stay near
- Explains why they were never found (open ocean in small boat = death)
- Nine empty barrels suggests pressure release did occur

**Remaining:** This is most consistent explanation

---

### CONSTRAINT 6: The Trailing Rope

**Evidence:**
- A rope or line was found trailing behind the ship
- Consistent with lifeboat being towed
- If rope broke, lifeboat would drift away quickly
- Ship under partial sail would outpace small boat

**What this means:** They probably didn't intend permanent abandonment. They meant to wait at safe distance. Something went wrong.

---

### CONSTRAINT 7: Court of Inquiry

**Evidence:**
- Vice-Admiralty Court in Gibraltar investigated
- Considered fraud and foul play — rejected
- No charges filed
- Dei Gratia crew received salvage payment (reduced, due to suspicions)

**What this means:** Official investigation found no evidence of crime.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Insurance fraud conspiracy (officially investigated and rejected)

---

## ANOMALIES

**"Why would an experienced captain abandon ship for fumes?"**
→ Commercial alcohol (denatured) can produce alarming fumes. A cautious captain with his wife and baby aboard might prioritize evacuation over risk assessment. The fumes were real; the explosion risk was overestimated.

**"Why wasn't the lifeboat found?"**
→ Open Atlantic in December. Small boat. No one searching in the right area quickly enough. They almost certainly died at sea within days.

**"Why the enduring mystery?"**
→ Early sensationalized accounts (including fiction by Arthur Conan Doyle) created mythology. The actual facts point to a straightforward tragedy.

All anomalies fit within remaining solution space.

## What This Means

We are not saying "the crew definitely abandoned ship due to alcohol fumes."

We are saying: "The crew deliberately took the lifeboat. Nothing was stolen. No one was killed. The ship was seaworthy. The cargo was volatile alcohol with evidence of off-gassing. The most consistent explanation is that Captain Briggs, with his family aboard, ordered abandonment due to perceived explosion risk, intended to wait at safe distance, and was lost when the connection to the ship failed."

Not a mystery. A tragedy of reasonable caution gone wrong.
