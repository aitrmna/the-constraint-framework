1968-1969. San Francisco Bay Area. A killer murdered at least five people, sent taunting letters to newspapers, and included cryptograms. He called himself "Zodiac."

He was never caught. He may still be alive.

## CONSTRAINT STACKING ANALYSIS

**CLAIM:** Who was the Zodiac Killer?

**STARTING SOLUTION SPACE:**
- Arthur Leigh Allen (most investigated suspect)
- Gary Francis Poste (2021 claim)
- Lawrence Kane
- Richard Gaikowski
- Other named suspects
- Unknown person never identified

---

### CONSTRAINT 1 (MOST DAMNING): No DNA/Fingerprint Match to Any Suspect

**Evidence:**
- DNA extracted from letter stamps (partial, possibly contaminated)
- Fingerprints from crime scenes
- None have matched any named suspect definitively
- Arthur Leigh Allen: DNA tested — no match
- Gary Francis Poste: 2021 claim, no DNA confirmation released

**What this means:** Despite extensive investigation, physical evidence hasn't identified the killer.

**For any specific suspect:**
- Must explain why DNA/prints don't match

**Assessment:** Either the physical evidence is too degraded, contaminated, or the real killer hasn't been tested

**ELIMINATES:**
- Nothing definitively — but casts doubt on all named suspects

---

### CONSTRAINT 2: Witness Descriptions — Inconsistent

**Evidence:**
- Surviving victim (Bryan Hartnell) at Lake Berryessa: Described man in executioner-style hood
- Stine murder witnesses (teenagers): Saw man leaving cab, produced composite sketch
- Composite shows: White male, heavy-set, glasses, crew cut
- Description partially matches Allen, partially matches others

**What this means:** Witness accounts exist but aren't precise enough to eliminate suspects.

**For Allen:**
- Friends noted resemblance to composite
- Similar build and appearance

**Against Allen:**
- Witnesses later couldn't pick him from lineup (but decades had passed)

**Assessment:** Witness descriptions narrow but don't identify

**ELIMINATES:**
- Anyone who drastically differs from composite

---

### CONSTRAINT 3: The Ciphers — What They Tell Us

**Evidence:**
- Four ciphers sent to newspapers
- Z408: Cracked in 1969 by amateur codebreakers. Message about killing being fun. No identification.
- Z340: Cracked in 2020 after 51 years. Message about collecting "slaves" for afterlife. No identification.
- Z13 and Z32: Still unsolved (short, may be meaningless or names)

**What this means:** Zodiac was literate, interested in puzzles, had morbid philosophy. Ciphers haven't identified him.

**For investigation:**
- Cipher content doesn't name the killer
- Style doesn't uniquely match any suspect's known writings

**ELIMINATES:**
- Nothing — ciphers are clues about personality, not identity

---

### CONSTRAINT 4: Arthur Leigh Allen — The Primary Suspect

**Evidence FOR Allen:**
- Owned Zodiac-brand watch (Zodiac referenced in letters)
- Friend reported Allen said he wanted to kill people and call himself Zodiac (before murders)
- Lived near Lake Berryessa
- Wore Wing Walker boots (matching print at Berryessa scene)
- Was reported to police by multiple people independently

**Evidence AGAINST Allen:**
- DNA from stamps doesn't match (could be contaminated, could be someone else licked stamps)
- Fingerprints don't match
- Handwriting experts: Inconclusive/excluded
- Was interviewed repeatedly — never confessed, passed polygraph (unreliable)
- Died 1992, never charged

**Assessment:** Strongest circumstantial suspect. Physical evidence doesn't confirm. Cannot eliminate.

---

### CONSTRAINT 5: Gary Francis Poste — The 2021 Claim

**Evidence FOR Poste:**
- "Case Breakers" group claimed match in 2021
- Claimed scars on forehead match composite sketch lines
- Claimed anagram of name in Z340 cipher
- Poste died 2018

**Evidence AGAINST Poste:**
- FBI and local agencies did not confirm
- No DNA match announced
- "Forehead scar" evidence disputed
- Anagram claims are easy to manufacture

**Assessment:** Claim not substantiated by authorities. Cannot confirm or eliminate definitively.

---

### CONSTRAINT 6: The Killings Stopped

**Evidence:**
- Last confirmed Zodiac murder: October 1969 (Paul Stine)
- Last confirmed letter: January 1974
- Possible reasons for stopping:
  - Died
  - Imprisoned for other crime
  - Moved away
  - Simply stopped

**What this means:** Something caused the Zodiac to cease activity.

**For Allen:**
- Arrested for child molestation in 1974 — timing fits
- But murders stopped in 1969, letters continued until 1974

**For other suspects:**
- Need to explain 1969 stop or show they could continue letters from elsewhere

**Assessment:** Timing doesn't eliminate any top suspect

---

### CONSTRAINT 7: Multiple Victims Survived Attacks

**Evidence:**
- Bryan Hartnell: Survived Lake Berryessa stabbing
- Mike Mageau: Survived Blue Rock Springs shooting
- Both provided descriptions

**What this means:** Unlike many serial killers, Zodiac didn't ensure kills. Either overconfident or not as competent as projected.

**Assessment:** Personality insight but doesn't identify

---

## THE PROBLEM: CONSTRAINTS DON'T CONVERGE

Unlike cases where one suspect survives and others are eliminated, the Zodiac case has:
- Physical evidence that excludes top suspects (but may be unreliable)
- Circumstantial evidence pointing to Allen (but not conclusive)
- No confession, no definitive proof
- Case officially open

---

## RESULT

| Hypothesis | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Arthur Leigh Allen | **Cannot eliminate** — strongest circumstantial case, DNA mismatch unexplained |
| Gary Francis Poste | **Cannot eliminate** — claim unverified but not disproven |
| Lawrence Kane | **Cannot eliminate** — some circumstantial links |
| Unknown person | **Cannot eliminate** — physical evidence matches no one tested |

---

## What This Means

We are not saying "the Zodiac Killer was Arthur Leigh Allen" or anyone else.

We are saying: "Multiple suspects have circumstantial evidence. No suspect has been confirmed by physical evidence. The constraints narrow the field but don't identify the killer. Either the physical evidence is flawed, or the real killer was never seriously investigated."

55+ years. Still unsolved.

**Some mysteries don't resolve because the evidence is insufficient to converge.** The Zodiac case may never be solved unless new evidence emerges or someone confesses.

This is what genuine investigative uncertainty looks like.
