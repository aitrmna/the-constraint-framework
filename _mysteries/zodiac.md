description: Five confirmed kills, encrypted letters, never caught
result: Insufficient evidence - multiple suspects, none confirmed

1968-1969. San Francisco Bay Area. A killer murdered at least five people, sent taunting letters with cryptograms to newspapers. Called himself "Zodiac."

Never caught. 55+ years. Still unsolved.

**The test:** Can we eliminate any suspects? Does evidence converge?

---

## The Problem

**Unlike most mysteries, Zodiac evidence doesn't eliminate alternatives.**

Physical evidence (DNA, fingerprints) exists but:
- Matches no named suspect
- May be contaminated/degraded
- Could be from wrong person (letter handler, not killer)

Circumstantial evidence points to multiple suspects but confirms none.

---

## Top Suspects

1. **Arthur Leigh Allen** (died 1992) - Most investigated
2. **Gary Francis Poste** (died 2018) - 2021 claim by "Case Breakers"
3. **Unknown person** never identified

---

## Testing Arthur Leigh Allen

**What would confirm him:**
- DNA/fingerprint match
- Definitive handwriting match
- Confession or witness testimony

**Reality check:**

**DNA matches?** → ✗ FAIL
- DNA from letter stamps tested
- No match to Allen

**Fingerprints match?** → ✗ FAIL
- Prints from crime scenes tested
- No match to Allen

**Handwriting matches?** → ⚠️ UNCLEAR
- Experts inconclusive or excluded
- Not definitive either way

**Circumstantial evidence:**
- Owned Zodiac-brand watch → ✓ (Zodiac referenced in letters)
- Friend reported Allen said he wanted to kill and call himself Zodiac → ✓ (before murders)
- Lived near Lake Berryessa → ✓
- Wore Wing Walker boots → ✓ (matching print at scene)
- Resembled composite sketch → ⚠️ (witnesses couldn't pick from lineup decades later)

**Score:** Strong circumstantial case. Physical evidence doesn't confirm.

**Result:** Cannot eliminate, cannot confirm.

## Testing Gary Francis Poste

**"Case Breakers" 2021 claim:**
- Forehead scars match composite sketch
- Anagram of name in Z340 cipher
- Other circumstantial links

**Reality check:**

**FBI/authorities confirm?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- FBI didn't confirm claim
- Local agencies didn't confirm
- Not official conclusion

**DNA confirmed?** → ✗ FAIL
- No DNA match announced
- If matched, would have been headline

**Forehead scars?** → ⚠️ UNCLEAR
- Disputed by others
- Composite sketch interpretation subjective

**Anagram?** → ⚠️ UNCLEAR
- Easy to find patterns in text
- No independent verification

**Score:** Unsubstantiated claim by private group.

**Result:** Cannot eliminate, cannot confirm. Weaker case than Allen.

## Why This Case Won't Resolve

**Physical evidence exists but:**
- DNA may be contaminated (envelope licker might not be killer)
- Fingerprints may be from innocent handlers
- 50+ years of degradation

**Circumstantial evidence points to Allen but:**
- Physical evidence doesn't match
- Never confessed
- Passed polygraph (unreliable but worth noting)
- Died 1992

**The constraints don't converge.**

## Comparison

| Suspect | Circumstantial | Physical Evidence | Status |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Arthur Leigh Allen | Strong | Doesn't match | Cannot eliminate or confirm |
| Gary Francis Poste | Weak | Not tested | Cannot confirm claim |
| Unknown person | N/A | Matches no one | Possible |

## What This Means

**Some mysteries don't resolve.**

The evidence narrows the field but doesn't identify the killer. Either:
- Physical evidence is flawed/contaminated
- Real killer never seriously investigated
- Killer is one of named suspects but evidence insufficient

**Zodiac case shows framework's limits:** When evidence is insufficient or contradictory, you get "cannot eliminate multiple hypotheses."

That's the honest answer.

---

**Status:** Officially unsolved
**Strongest suspect:** Arthur Leigh Allen (circumstantial only)
**Confidence:** Low (insufficient evidence to conclude)
**Resolution:** May never happen unless new evidence emerges
