title: Tehran 1976
subtitle: Iran, September 1976
description: Military jets, weapons interference, radar confirmation
result: Strong case - 8:1 for unknown technology
category: uap
---

September 19, 1976. Tehran, Iran. Object reported by citizens, confirmed on radar. Iranian Air Force scrambled two F-4 Phantom jets. Pilots experienced weapons systems failures when attempting lock. Object demonstrated extreme maneuvers. Documented in US Defense Intelligence Agency report.

**One of the best-documented military encounters.**

**The test:** What must be true for each explanation? Does reality match?

## Competing Hypotheses

1. Jupiter misidentification
2. Aircraft malfunction
3. Secret US technology
4. Unknown technology

---

## H1: Jupiter Misidentification

**What must be true:**
- Stationary or very slow movement
- No radar confirmation
- No weapons interference

**Reality check:**

**Stationary?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Jupiter doesn't move rapidly
- Object demonstrated extreme acceleration
- Kills hypothesis

**No radar?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Planets don't show on air traffic radar
- Object confirmed on radar

**No weapons effect?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Planets don't affect aircraft systems
- Both F-4s experienced failures during lock attempt

**Score:** 0/3 passes, 3 critical fails
Calculation: 0% × (1 - 0.6) = **0%**

**Result:** Dead. Three critical failures.

---

## H2: Aircraft Malfunction

**What must be true:**
- Independent failures possible
- No radar object
- Failures random timing

**Reality check:**

**Independent failures?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Two separate F-4s, same failures
- Both during attempted weapon lock
- Too coincidental

**No radar?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Ground radar confirmed object
- Not just pilot error

**Random timing?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- Failures occurred during lock attempt
- Systems recovered after breaking off
- Suggests directed effect, not random

**Score:** 0/3 passes, 2 critical + 1 major fails
Calculation: 0% × (1 - 0.7) = **0%**

**Result:** Dead. Pattern suggests directed interference.

---

## H3: Secret US Technology

**What must be true:**
- US would test over hostile nation
- Technology deployed in 47 years since
- DIA wouldn't document as unknown

**Reality check:**

**Would test over Iran?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- Iran potentially hostile in 1976
- International incident risk
- Unlikely test location

**Technology deployed?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- 1976 event
- No similar tech deployed anywhere since
- 47 years without deployment implausible

**DIA wouldn't document?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- DIA filed report as unknown
- Wouldn't document own secret tech this way

**Score:** 0/3 passes, 3 major fails
Calculation: 0% × (1 - 0.3) = **0%**

Adjusted: **~10%** (possible but very implausible)

**Result:** Major failures on all predictions. Highly unlikely.

---

## H4: Unknown Technology

**What must be true:**
- Radar + visual confirmation
- Extreme performance beyond 1976 aircraft
- Systems interference (directed effect)
- Multiple independent witnesses
- DIA takes seriously
- Never identified despite investigation

**Reality check:**

**Radar + visual?** → ✓ PASS
- Ground radar confirmed
- Multiple pilots witnessed

**Extreme performance?** → ✓ PASS
- Rapid acceleration observed
- Beyond known 1976 aircraft capability

**Systems interference?** → ✓ PASS
- Weapons failed during lock attempt
- Recovered when disengaging
- Both F-4s affected
- Suggests directed effect

**Multiple witnesses?** → ✓ PASS
- Ground observers
- Air traffic control
- Two F-4 crews

**DIA took seriously?** → ✓ PASS
- Detailed report filed
- Classified then declassified
- No dismissal as error

**Never identified?** → ✓ PASS
- 47 years later, still unknown
- No mundane explanation found

**Score:** 6/6 passes
Calculation: 100% × (1 - 0) = **100%**

Adjusted for limited data release: **~80%**

## Comparison

| Hypothesis | Score | Critical Failures |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| **Unknown technology** | **80%** | **0** |
| Secret US tech | 10% | 0 (but 3 major) |
| Jupiter | 0% | 3 |
| Malfunction | 0% | 2 |

**Advantage:** 80% / 10% = **8:1**

---

## What Makes This Strong

**Unique feature: Weapons interference**
- Both F-4s experienced failures during lock
- Systems recovered when disengaging
- Suggests directed effect
- No mundane explanation

**Plus standard strong evidence:**
- Multi-sensor confirmation (radar + visual)
- Multiple witnesses
- Extreme performance
- Official DIA documentation

**Similar quality to Tic Tac, different details:**
- Tic Tac: 15:1, physics violations, multi-sensor
- Tehran: 8:1, weapons interference, DIA report

Both are high-quality cases with strong evidence.

---

**Confidence:** High (8:1 advantage)
**Status:** Cannot eliminate unknown technology
**Distinguishing feature:** Weapons system interference during lock attempt
