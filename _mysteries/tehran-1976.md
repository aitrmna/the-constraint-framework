title: Tehran 1976 Incident
subtitle: Iran, September 1976
description: Military jets scrambled, weapons interference, radar confirmation
result: Strong case - 8:1 for unknown technology
category: uap
---

September 19, 1976. Tehran, Iran. Object reported by multiple citizens, confirmed on radar. Iranian Air Force scrambled two F-4 Phantom jets. Pilots experienced weapons systems failures when attempting lock. Object demonstrated extreme maneuvers. Documented in US Defense Intelligence Agency report.

**One of the best-documented military encounters.**

## THE MYSTERY

**Core Question:** What did Iranian Air Force jets encounter over Tehran?

**Key Evidence:**
- Civilian reports from ground
- Air traffic control radar confirmation
- Two F-4 jets scrambled
- Weapons system interference (both jets)
- Second object detached from first
- Extreme acceleration observed
- DIA report (declassified)

## COMPETING HYPOTHESES

**H1: Astronomical Misidentification (Jupiter)**
- Planet Jupiter was visible
- Pilots misidentified bright object

**H2: Aircraft Malfunction**
- F-4 systems failed independently
- No actual object

**H3: Secret US Technology**
- Testing near Iran during Cold War
- Weapons interference was deliberate

**H4: Unknown Technology**
- Performance beyond known capability
- Weapons interference unexplained

## PREDICTIONS & TESTING

### H1: Jupiter Misidentification

**Predictions:**

1. **Stationary or slow movement** → ✗ **CRITICAL FAIL**
   - Jupiter doesn't move rapidly
   - Object demonstrated extreme acceleration

2. **No radar confirmation** → ✗ **CRITICAL FAIL**
   - Planets don't show on air traffic radar
   - Object confirmed on radar

3. **No weapons interference** → ✗ **CRITICAL FAIL**
   - Planets don't affect aircraft systems
   - Both F-4s experienced failures

**Score:** 0/3 **= 0%**

---

### H2: Aircraft Malfunction

**Predictions:**

1. **Independent failures unlikely** → ✗ **CRITICAL FAIL**
   - Two separate F-4s, same failures
   - During attempted weapon lock

2. **No radar object** → ✗ **CRITICAL FAIL**
   - Ground radar confirmed object
   - Not just pilot error

3. **Failures random** → ✗ **MAJOR FAIL**
   - Failures occurred during lock attempt
   - Systems recovered after breaking off
   - Too coincidental

**Score:** 0/3 **= 0%**

---

### H3: Secret US Technology

**Predictions:**

1. **US wouldn't test over hostile nation** → ✗ **MAJOR FAIL**
   - Iran potentially hostile 1976
   - International incident risk

2. **Technology exists today** → ✗ **MAJOR FAIL**
   - 1976 event
   - No deployment of similar tech since

3. **DIA report wouldn't exist** → ✗ **MAJOR FAIL**
   - DIA documented as unknown
   - Wouldn't file report on own tech

**Score:** 0/3 **= ~10%** (possible but implausible)

---

### H4: Unknown Technology

**Predictions:**

1. **Radar + visual confirmation** → ✓ **PASS**
   - Both confirmed

2. **Extreme performance** → ✓ **PASS**
   - Rapid acceleration observed
   - Beyond known 1976 aircraft

3. **Systems interference** → ✓ **PASS**
   - Weapons failed during lock attempt
   - Recovered when disengaging
   - Suggests directed effect

4. **Multiple independent witnesses** → ✓ **PASS**
   - Ground observers
   - Air traffic control
   - Two F-4 crews

5. **DIA takes seriously** → ✓ **PASS**
   - Detailed report filed
   - Classified then declassified

6. **Never identified** → ✓ **PASS**
   - 47 years later, still unknown

**Score:** 6/6 **= 100%**
**Overall Fit:** **80%** (slight reduction for limited data release)

## COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

| Hypothesis | Overall Fit |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Unknown Technology** | **80%** |
| Secret US Tech | 10% |
| Jupiter | 0% |
| Malfunction | 0% |

**Advantage Ratio:** 80% / 10% = **8:1**

**Interpretation:** Unknown technology strongly favored.

## CONSTRAINT STACKING

**CONSTRAINT 1: Weapons Interference**
- Both F-4s experienced failure during lock attempt
- Systems recovered when disengaging
- **Eliminates:** Jupiter, simple malfunction
- **Suggests:** Directed effect

**CONSTRAINT 2: Radar + Visual**
- Ground radar confirmed
- Multiple pilots witnessed
- **Eliminates:** Misidentification, hallucination

**CONSTRAINT 3: Extreme Performance**
- Rapid acceleration beyond 1976 aircraft
- **Eliminates:** Known technology

**CONSTRAINT 4: DIA Documentation**
- US intelligence took seriously
- Filed as unknown
- **Eliminates:** US secret program

**All constraints converge: Unknown technology**

---

## WHAT THIS CASE SHOWS

**Strong evidence pattern:**
- Multi-sensor confirmation
- Weapons system interference (unique feature)
- Multiple witnesses
- Official documentation
- No mundane explanation fits

**Similar to Tic Tac in quality, different in details.**

**Confidence:** High (8:1 advantage)
