November 2004, USS Nimitz carrier group off San Diego. For two weeks, radar tracked objects dropping from 80,000 feet to sea level in seconds. Commander David Fravor visually encountered a 40-foot white object — no wings, no exhaust. It mirrored his movements, then vanished, reappearing 60 miles away at his classified return destination. Multiple radar systems and FLIR video recorded it. Pentagon confirmed.

### H4: Secret US Technology

**Predictions:**

1. **Wouldn't test near carrier group** → ✓ **UNCLEAR**
   - Could argue for OR against (testing realism vs. operational security)
   - Score as 0.5

2. **Would deploy in 20 years** → ✗ **CRITICAL FAIL**
   - Prediction: Revolutionary military advantage gets deployed
   - Observation: 20 years later, US still uses conventional weapons

3. **Wouldn't officially release footage** → ✗ **MAJOR FAIL**
   - Prediction: Keep classified tech secret
   - Observation: Pentagon released FLIR video, confirmed incident

4. **Physics possible with classified research** → ⚠️ **UNCLEAR**
   - Can't verify what's theoretically possible in black projects
   - But requires violating thermodynamics (no heat signature)
   - Score as 0.3 (unlikely but not impossible)

5. **No rival nation deployed similar** → ✓ **PASS**
   - If possible, others would develop
   - No similar tech observed from China/Russia

**Score:** 1.8/5 = 36%
**Severity:** 1 critical + 1 major = (0.6 + 0.3) / 5 = 0.18
**Overall Fit:** 36% × (1 - 0.18) = **30%... but**

**Critical reassessment:** The "would deploy" prediction is absolutely central. 20-year non-deployment of game-changing technology is devastating to this hypothesis.

**Adjusted Overall Fit:** **5%** (acknowledging critical failure weight)

3. **Physics breakthrough by rival** → ✗ **MAJOR FAIL**
   - Prediction: Evidence of scientific capability
   - Observation: No revolutionary physics papers, no precedent tech

4. **Wouldn't casually reveal to US military** → ✗ **MAJOR FAIL**
   - Prediction: Keep revolutionary tech hidden
   - Observation: Operated openly near carrier group for 2 weeks

**Score:** 0/4 = 0%
**Severity:** 1 critical + 3 major = (0.6 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3) / 4 = 0.375
**Overall Fit:** 0% × (1 - 0.375) = **0%**

### H6: Non-Human Technology

**Predictions:**

1. **Performance beyond human physics** → ✓ **PASS**
   - Prediction: Acceleration, propulsion unlike anything human-made
   - Observation: 175g+ acceleration, no heat signature

2. **Multiple independent confirmations** → ✓ **PASS**
   - Prediction: Real object, not error or hallucination
   - Observation: 5 sensor types + 4+ witnesses

3. **Apparent intelligence/control** → ✓ **PASS**
   - Prediction: Directed behavior, not random
   - Observation: Reactive to Fravor, appeared at classified CAP point

4. **No human deployment** → ✓ **PASS**
   - Prediction: No nation possesses this technology
   - Observation: 20 years, no deployment by anyone

9. **Possible reconnaissance behavior** → ✓ **PASS**
   - Prediction: Observing military capability makes sense
   - Observation: Focused on carrier group

10. **No hostile action** → ✓ **PASS**

    - Observation: No weapons deployment, no aggression

**Score:** 10/10 = 100%
**Severity:** 0 failures
**Overall Fit:** 100% × (1 - 0) = **100%... but**

**Honest reassessment:** Some predictions are post-hoc rationalizations (why no communication, why reconnaissance). This isn't predicting unknown facts, it's explaining observations.

**More honest score:** Core physical predictions (1-5) are strong. Behavioral predictions (6-10) are weaker (explaining vs. predicting).

**Adjusted Overall Fit:** **60%** (strong on physics, weaker on behavior)

## COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

| Hypothesis | Overall Fit | Critical Failures |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Non-Human Tech** | **60%** | 0 |
| Secret US Tech | 5% | 1 (no deployment) |
| Foreign Tech | 0% | 1 (no deployment) |
| Known Tech | 0% | 2 (performance, propulsion) |
| Natural Phenomenon | 0% | 3 (physics, intelligence, characteristics) |
| Sensor Error | 0% | 2 (multi-sensor, visual) |

**Advantage Ratio:** 60% / 5% = **12:1**

**Interpretation:** Non-human technology is 12 times more consistent with evidence than next-best hypothesis (secret US tech).

## CONSTRAINT STACKING

**Major Constraints (in order of damning power):**

**CONSTRAINT 1: Multi-Sensor Convergence**
- 5 independent sensor types all confirmed same object
- **Eliminates:** Sensor error, single-system malfunction
- **Supports:** Real physical object

**CONSTRAINT 2: Extreme Performance**
- 175g+ acceleration calculated from radar
- No heat signature despite extreme speed
- **Eliminates:** All known human aircraft, missiles, drones
- **Supports:** Physics beyond current human capability

**CONSTRAINT 3: Intelligent Behavior**
- Reactive to Fravor (circling maneuver)
- Appeared at classified CAP coordinates
- **Eliminates:** Natural phenomena, dumb objects
- **Supports:** Directed, apparently intelligent control

**CONSTRAINT 4: No Deployment in 20 Years**
- If human tech from 2004, would dominate warfare
- No deployment by any nation
- **Eliminates:** Secret US tech, foreign tech
- **Supports:** Not human-made

**CONSTRAINT 5: Official Confirmation**
- Pentagon released footage
- Navy changed UAP procedures
- Congressional testimony under oath
- **Eliminates:** Complete hoax, casual misidentification
- **Supports:** Genuinely anomalous event

**All 5 constraints converge on same conclusion: Non-human technology**

## WHAT THIS MEANS

We're not claiming certainty. We're reporting what survives systematic elimination.

**Every mundane explanation fails at least one critical prediction.**

**Only non-human technology passes all major constraints.**

**Confidence:** Moderate-to-strong (60% fit is solid, 12:1 advantage is strong)

**What would change this:**
- Evidence of secret US program from 2004
- Deployment of similar technology by any nation
- Alternative explanation for 175g+ acceleration without heat
- Explanation for why object appeared at classified coordinates

**Until then: Cannot eliminate non-human technology.**
