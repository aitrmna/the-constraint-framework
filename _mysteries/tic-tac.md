November 2004. USS Nimitz carrier group, off San Diego.

For two weeks, the Navy's most advanced radar systems had been tracking strange objects. They appeared at 80,000 feet, dropped to sea level in seconds, hovered, then shot back up. The radar operators thought their equipment was broken.

Then Commander David Fravor saw one with his own eyes.

---

## What Happened

Fravor was a Top Gun graduate with 18 years of flight experience. He was flying an F/A-18 Super Hornet on a routine training mission when he was redirected to investigate a contact.

What he saw: A white object, about 40 feet long, shaped like a Tic Tac. No wings. No exhaust. No visible propulsion. It was hovering over a disturbance in the water.

When Fravor descended to investigate, the object rose to meet him. They "merged" — circled each other. Then it accelerated away. Not fast. *Instantaneously*. One moment it was there. Then it was gone.

It reappeared 60 miles away — at Fravor's CAP point (the location he was supposed to return to). This was on radar. The object somehow knew where he was going.

A second aircraft was launched with a FLIR targeting pod. Lieutenant Chad Underwood got the famous video — the object appearing to rotate, maintaining impossible speed, no heat signature from propulsion.

## The Evidence

This isn't just a story someone told. Multiple independent systems recorded it:

- **SPY-1 radar** (USS Princeton) — Ship-based, most advanced naval radar
- **E-2C Hawkeye radar** — Airborne early warning aircraft
- **F/A-18 radar** — Fravor's own aircraft
- **FLIR video** — Infrared targeting system
- **Four pilot eyewitnesses** — Two aircraft, two crew each
- **Multiple radar operators** — Two weeks of tracking

The Pentagon confirmed this happened. They released the video. Multiple officers have testified to Congress under oath.

This is not "lights in the sky." This is multi-sensor military data.

## The Hypotheses

Something was there. What was it? Here are the options:

1. **Sensor malfunction / misidentification** — Equipment glitched, pilots misread it
2. **Secret US technology** — We built it, kept it classified
3. **Foreign adversary** — China or Russia built it
4. **Hoax or psyop** — Deliberate deception
5. **Unknown natural phenomenon** — Atmospheric weirdness
6. **Non-human intelligence** — Something else

Let's test each one against what we actually know.

## Testing the Explanations

### 1. Sensor Malfunction

**The claim:** The radar was glitching. The pilots saw something ordinary and misinterpreted it.

**What it has to explain:**

- Multiple independent radar systems (ship, airborne, aircraft) all malfunctioning the same way
- FLIR camera also malfunctioning the same way
- Four trained pilots all misidentifying the same thing
- Two weeks of consistent "malfunctions"
- The object appearing at Fravor's CAP point — radar somehow "knowing" classified coordinates

**Verdict:** Multiple independent systems don't fail identically. This explanation requires an extraordinary coincidence across every sensor and every witness.

**Survival probability:** ~5%

### 2. Secret US Technology

**The claim:** The US has physics-breaking tech and was testing it.

**What it has to explain:**

- Why test against your own carrier group without telling them?
- Why allow pilots to report it, testify to Congress, go on TV?
- Why release the video yourself?
- Where's the physics? Instantaneous acceleration means either no inertia or unlimited energy
- Why haven't we used it in 20 years?

**Verdict:** The behavior makes no sense. If we had this tech, we wouldn't expose it by playing games with our own pilots. And we'd have used it by now.

**Survival probability:** ~5%

### 3. Foreign Adversary (China/Russia)

**The claim:** China or Russia has technology generations ahead of us.

**What it has to explain:**

- Technology that breaks known physics (instantaneous acceleration = no inertia)
- Demonstrated in 2004 — 20 years ago — with no military use since
- No visible propulsion, no heat signature
- They'd have to be 100+ years ahead of our physics
- Neither country has shown anything remotely close in actual conflicts

**Verdict:** Russia can't make working tanks. China's best jets are copies of Russian designs. Neither has physics that makes objects accelerate at 5,000g.

**Survival probability:** ~2%

### 4. Hoax or Psyop

**The claim:** Someone faked this for... reasons.

**What it has to explain:**

- Coordinated deception across multiple military systems
- Multiple officers willing to perjure themselves before Congress
- The Pentagon confirming fake events
- 20 years of consistent lying by everyone involved
- What's the motive? This doesn't help anyone

**Verdict:** The conspiracy required is enormous. And the payoff is... what? Making the military look confused? This is desperate.

**Survival probability:** ~3%

### 5. Unknown Natural Phenomenon

**The claim:** Some atmospheric weirdness we don't understand yet.

**What it has to explain:**

- A physical object visible on multiple sensors
- That appears solid and 40 feet long
- That reacts to Fravor's movements (circled with him)
- That knew his CAP point and went there
- That demonstrates apparent intelligence

**Verdict:** Weather doesn't play games. Atmospheric phenomena don't intercept pilots and predict their navigation. This isn't ball lightning.

**Survival probability:** ~5%

### 6. Non-Human Intelligence

**The claim:** Something not made by humans.

**What it requires:**

- That intelligence exists beyond humans (big assumption, but: large universe)
- That it can get here (unclear how)
- That it was observed in 2004 (matches the evidence)

**What it explains:**

- Technology beyond known physics — yes, that's what we'd expect
- Apparent interest in military assets — plausible for recon
- Not attacking — consistent with observation
- The weirdness — if anything, too mundane for a truly alien encounter

**Verdict:** It's an extraordinary claim. But it's the only one that doesn't require explaining away the evidence. Every other hypothesis has to say "the data is wrong." This one says "the data is right, and here's what that means."

**Survival probability:** ~80%

## The Math

Let's be honest about uncertainty. These aren't precise numbers. But they force us to compare options.

| Hypothesis | Survival Probability |
|------------|---------------------|
| Sensor malfunction | ~5% |
| Secret US tech | ~5% |
| Foreign adversary | ~2% |
| Hoax/psyop | ~3% |
| Natural phenomenon | ~5% |
| Non-human intelligence | ~80% |

The "mundane" explanations total about 20%. The "extraordinary" explanation takes the rest.

I'm not certain it's aliens. But I'm fairly certain it's not the other things.

---

## What This Doesn't Tell Us

Even if it's non-human intelligence, we don't know:

- Where it's from (another planet? another dimension? Earth's oceans? the future?)
- What it wants
- Whether there's one or many
- How the technology works
- Whether "intelligence" means what we think it means

The framework narrows down what it *isn't*. The positive answer remains mysterious.

---

## Why This Matters

If you accept the evidence — and the Pentagon does — then something is flying around that isn't ours.

That's either:

- Physics we don't understand (massive implication for science)
- Intelligence we don't understand (massive implication for everything)

Either way, the "nothing to see here" response doesn't survive contact with the data.

---

## The Uncomfortable Position

Most people pick one of two positions:

**Position A:** "Obviously fake/misidentified. UFOs aren't real."
This requires ignoring or explaining away substantial evidence.

**Position B:** "Obviously aliens. The government knows everything."
This goes beyond what the evidence supports.

**The honest position:** "Something real was observed. It doesn't match any known human technology. We don't know what it is."

That's uncomfortable. We like certainty. But the evidence supports uncertainty, not either extreme.

---

## Test It Yourself

The evidence is public:

- The FLIR video (released by Pentagon)
- Commander Fravor's interviews (dozens available)
- Congressional testimony (public record)
- Pentagon confirmation (official statements)

Run your own analysis. What explanation survives all the evidence?

If you find one I missed, I want to hear it.
