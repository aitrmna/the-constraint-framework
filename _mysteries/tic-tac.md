November 2004, USS Nimitz carrier group off San Diego. For two weeks, radar tracked objects dropping from 80,000 feet to sea level in seconds. Commander David Fravor visually encountered a 40-foot white object—no wings, no exhaust. It mirrored his movements, then vanished, reappearing 60 miles away. Multiple radar systems and FLIR video recorded it. Pentagon confirmed.

**The test:** What must be true for each explanation? Does reality match?

## Competing Hypotheses

1. Sensor malfunction
2. Natural phenomenon
3. Known human technology
4. Secret US technology
5. Foreign adversary technology
6. Non-human technology

## H1: Sensor Malfunction

**What must be true:**
- Single sensor type affected
- No visual confirmation
- Brief duration
- Random behavior

**Reality check:**

**Single sensor?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- SPY-1 radar, E-2C radar, F/A-18 radar, FLIR infrared, visual
- Five independent systems confirmed same object

**No visual?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Four Navy pilots visually confirmed
- Solid white object, 40 feet long

**Brief?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- Tracked for 14 days straight
- Multiple encounters

**Random?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- Object mirrored Fravor's movements
- Appeared at classified CAP coordinates (only pilots knew)

**Score:** 0/4 passes, 2 critical + 2 major fails
Calculation: 0% × (1 - 0.45) = **0%**

**Result:** Dead. Multiple independent sensors + visual confirmation kills sensor error.

---

## H2: Natural Phenomenon

**What must be true:**
- Follows known physics (wind, thermodynamics)
- No apparent intelligence
- Identifiable characteristics (birds, weather, etc.)

**Reality check:**

**Known physics?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- 175g+ acceleration (no known natural process)
- Instant stop from hypersonic speed
- No heat signature despite extreme velocity

**No intelligence?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Appeared at Fravor's classified CAP point
- Reactive behavior (mirroring maneuvers)

**Identifiable?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- Solid manufactured-looking object
- No wings, no visible propulsion
- Not birds, not weather, not balloon

**Score:** 0/3 passes, 2 critical + 1 major fails
Calculation: 0% × (1 - 0.525) = **0%**

**Result:** Dead. Physics violations are critical failures.

---

## H3: Known Human Technology

**What must be true:**
- Performance within known limits (~15g aircraft, ~40g missiles)
- Visible propulsion (jets/rockets produce heat)
- Sonic boom at supersonic speed
- Identifiable design features

**Reality check:**

**Known limits?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Minimum 175g from radar tracks
- No known technology approaches this

**Visible propulsion?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- FLIR showed no heat signature
- No exhaust plume at any speed

**Sonic boom?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- Traveled 60 miles in under 1 minute
- No sonic boom reported

**Identifiable design?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- Smooth white oval
- No wings, rotors, control surfaces

**Score:** 0/4 passes, 2 critical + 2 major fails
Calculation: 0% × (1 - 0.45) = **0%**

**Result:** Dead. Exceeds all known performance by order of magnitude.

## H4: Secret US Technology

**What must be true:**
- Wouldn't test near carrier group (operational security)
- Would deploy within 20 years (game-changing advantage)
- Would remain classified (not officially release footage)
- Requires physics breakthrough (but possible)

**Reality check:**

**Avoid carrier group?** → ⚠️ UNCLEAR
- Could argue either way
- Count as 0.5

**Would deploy?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- 20 years later, US uses conventional weapons
- Ukraine war shows no revolutionary propulsion
- Game-changing tech doesn't sit unused for two decades

**Remain classified?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- Pentagon released FLIR video
- Confirmed incident publicly
- Congressional hearings

**Physics possible?** → ⚠️ UNCLEAR
- Unknown what's theoretically possible
- But: No heat signature violates thermodynamics
- Count as 0.3

**Score:** 0.8/4 passes, 1 critical + 1 major fails
Calculation: 20% × (1 - 0.225) = **15.5%**

But the non-deployment is devastating. Adjusted: **5%**

**Result:** Critical failure on deployment. If you have this in 2004, you use it.

## H5: Foreign Adversary Technology

**What must be true:**
- Would demonstrate in Ukraine/Taiwan conflicts
- Would be US's top intelligence priority
- Requires physics breakthrough (China/Russia capable?)
- Wouldn't reveal openly to US military

**Reality check:**

**Demonstrate in conflict?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Russia uses conventional weapons in Ukraine
- China uses conventional weapons/threats near Taiwan
- If they had this, they'd dominate

**Top intel priority?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- No evidence of massive reverse-engineering effort
- Not treated as foreign threat

**Physics breakthrough?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- No revolutionary physics papers from rivals
- No precedent technology demonstrated

**Wouldn't reveal?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- Operated openly for 2 weeks
- Casually revealed game-changing tech to carrier group

**Score:** 0/4 passes, 1 critical + 3 major fails
Calculation: 0% × (1 - 0.375) = **0%**

**Result:** Dead. No nation deploys this anywhere.

## H6: Non-Human Technology

**What must be true:**
- Performance beyond current human physics
- Real object (not error/hallucination)
- Intelligent control
- No human deployment (nobody has this)
- Would be taken seriously by military

**Reality check:**

**Beyond human physics?** → ✓ PASS
- 175g+ acceleration: check
- No heat signature: check
- Trans-medium capability: check

**Real object?** → ✓ PASS
- Five independent sensor types
- Four witnesses
- Pentagon confirmation

**Intelligent control?** → ✓ PASS
- Reactive to Fravor (mirroring)
- Appeared at classified coordinates
- Deliberate behavior

**No human deployment?** → ✓ PASS
- 20 years, no nation uses this
- If human-made, it would dominate warfare

**Taken seriously?** → ✓ PASS
- Pentagon released footage
- Navy changed UAP reporting procedures
- Congressional testimony

**Additional predictions:**
- Might not communicate → ✓ PASS (no contact attempted)
- Operates openly → ✓ PASS (2 weeks near carrier)
- No hostile action → ✓ PASS (observation only)

**But also:**
- Jammed AEGIS radar? → ✗ MINOR FAIL (AEGIS worked fine)
- No infrared signature? → ✗ MINOR FAIL (FLIR detected it, just no heat plume)

**Score:** 8/10 passes, 2 minor fails
Calculation: 80% × (1 - 0.02) = **78.4%**

**Result:** Survives. Minor sensor issues don't kill it. Core physics predictions all pass.

## Comparison

| Hypothesis | Score | Critical Failures |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| **Non-human tech** | **78%** | **0** |
| Secret US tech | 5% | 1 |
| Foreign tech | 0% | 1 |
| Known tech | 0% | 2 |
| Natural | 0% | 2 |
| Sensor error | 0% | 2 |

**Advantage:** 78% / 5% = **15.6:1** over next best

## What This Means

Every mundane explanation has critical failures:
- Sensor error: killed by multiple independent systems + visual
- Natural: killed by physics violations
- Known tech: killed by performance limits
- Secret US: killed by non-deployment
- Foreign: killed by non-deployment

Non-human technology:
- Zero critical failures
- Passes all major physics constraints
- Minor issues with sensor details
- Only hypothesis that survives

**This isn't proof. It's elimination.**

Reality killed every mundane hypothesis. Non-human tech is what remains.

**What would change this:**
- Evidence of secret US program from 2004
- Any nation deploying similar technology
- Alternative explanation for 175g+ without heat
- Explanation for classified CAP coordinates

**Until then:** Cannot eliminate non-human technology.

---

**Confidence:** Strong (78% fit, 15:1 advantage)
**Status:** Only viable hypothesis after systematic elimination
