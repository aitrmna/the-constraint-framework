2007. Astronomers reviewing archival data found a radio burst lasting 5 milliseconds, originating from outside our galaxy. In that instant, it released as much energy as the Sun does in days.

We now detect dozens per day. Some repeat. Most don't. We've located some sources. We still don't fully understand them.

## CONSTRAINT STACKING ANALYSIS

**CLAIM:** What are Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)?

**STARTING SOLUTION SPACE:**
- Instrumental error
- Terrestrial interference
- Exotic natural phenomenon (new type of astrophysics)
- Extraterrestrial technology

---

### CONSTRAINT 1 (MOST DAMNING): Extragalactic Origin Confirmed

**Evidence:**
- Dispersion measure: Lower frequencies arrive later (traveled through intergalactic medium)
- Amount of dispersion indicates billions of light years of travel
- Some FRBs localized to specific host galaxies
- FRB 121102 traced to dwarf galaxy 3 billion light years away
- Parallax and dispersion confirm vast distances

**What this means:** These signals genuinely originate from deep space, not Earth or our solar system.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Terrestrial interference (wrong dispersion, confirmed from space)
- ❌ Instrumental error at single telescope (multiple facilities detect same events)

**Remaining:** Exotic natural phenomenon or extraterrestrial technology

---

### CONSTRAINT 2: Magnetar Association — SGR 1935+2154

**Evidence:**
- April 2020: FRB detected from WITHIN our galaxy
- Source: Magnetar SGR 1935+2154 (neutron star with extreme magnetic field)
- First FRB associated with known object type
- Timing coincided with X-ray burst from same magnetar

**What this means:** At least SOME FRBs come from magnetars. Proof of concept for natural explanation.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ All FRBs must be artificial (natural source confirmed for at least one)

**Remaining:** Natural phenomenon (magnetars or related), possibly multiple source types

---

### CONSTRAINT 3: Repeating vs. Non-Repeating

**Evidence:**
- Most FRBs: One-time events, never repeat
- Some FRBs: Repeat from same location (FRB 121102 repeated hundreds of times)
- Repeaters have different statistical properties than non-repeaters
- Suggests possibly multiple source types

**What this means:** Not all FRBs are identical. Different mechanisms may produce different types.

**For ET hypothesis:**
- Repeaters could be beacons, non-repeaters could be one-time events

**For natural hypothesis:**
- Different stellar phenomena (some repeat, some are catastrophic one-time events)

**Assessment:** Multiple source types supports natural diversity of astrophysics

**Remaining:** Primarily natural, possibly multiple mechanisms

---

### CONSTRAINT 4: Energy and Duration

**Evidence:**
- Duration: Typically 1-5 milliseconds
- Energy: 10^36 - 10^40 joules in that instant
- This is enormous — equivalent to Sun's output over days, in milliseconds
- Must come from compact object (normal star can't pulse this fast)

**What this means:** Source must be something extreme — neutron star, magnetar, black hole vicinity.

**For natural explanation:**
- Magnetars already confirmed capable of similar emissions
- Extreme magnetic reconnection events
- Neutron star collapse or merger

**For ET:**
- Requires energy production beyond any known civilization's capability
- If artificial, why so brief? Why one-time?

**Assessment:** Natural explanation fits energy/duration profile. ET requires extraordinary assumptions.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Ordinary stellar phenomena (can't produce millisecond bursts at this energy)

**Remaining:** Extreme compact objects (magnetars, neutron stars) — natural

---

### CONSTRAINT 5: Localization to Host Galaxies

**Evidence:**
- Several FRBs localized to host galaxies
- Found in various galaxy types (massive, dwarf, star-forming, older)
- Locations often near star-forming regions
- Consistent with young neutron star / magnetar formation

**What this means:** FRBs come from environments where we expect extreme stellar remnants.

**For natural:**
- Magnetars form from massive star deaths — found in star-forming regions ✓
- Locations make sense

**For ET:**
- Why would ET signals come specifically from star-forming regions?
- No correlation with expected "habitable" zones

**Assessment:** Spatial distribution matches natural hypothesis

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ ET focused on habitable systems (wrong locations)

**Remaining:** Natural astrophysical sources

---

### CONSTRAINT 6: No Information Content Detected

**Evidence:**
- FRB signals are broadband bursts
- No modulation pattern suggesting encoding
- No detected structure beyond natural dispersion
- If messages, we can't find them

**What this means:** Nothing suggests these are artificial signals carrying information.

**For ET:**
- Could be propulsion or other non-communication tech
- Could be encoding we don't recognize

**For natural:**
- Matches expectations for explosive astrophysical events

**Assessment:** Absence of evidence of artificiality

**Remaining:** Natural (default)

## ANOMALIES

**"Some FRBs repeat with possible periodicity"**
→ FRB 180916 showed ~16-day cycle. Now explained by orbital dynamics of magnetar in binary system or precession. Natural explanation found.

**"Why so many?"**
→ We now detect ~1,000+ per day across the sky. This is consistent with neutron stars being common (billions in our galaxy alone).

**"Some are incredibly bright — could they be artificial?"**
→ Brightness requires extreme but natural energy sources. Magnetars fit. No need for artificial explanation.

All anomalies fit within natural source model.

## RESULT

| Hypothesis | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Instrumental error | ❌ Eliminated |
| Terrestrial interference | ❌ Eliminated |
| Extraterrestrial technology | Not eliminated, but no supporting evidence |
| **Exotic natural phenomenon (magnetars/neutron stars)** | **Cannot eliminate — strongly supported** |

## What This Means

We are not saying "FRBs are definitely all from magnetars."

We are saying: "Fast Radio Bursts are real signals from billions of light years away. At least one has been traced to a magnetar in our own galaxy, confirming natural origin is possible. The energy, duration, host environments, and lack of information content all fit natural astrophysical models. The ET hypothesis is not eliminated but has no positive evidence supporting it."

**This is what a "mundane" explanation looks like for something initially mysterious.** 

When we first found FRBs, they seemed inexplicable. Now we have a working model: extreme magnetic events on neutron stars. Science progressed. The mystery narrowed.

Not everything is unknown forever. Sometimes we figure it out.
