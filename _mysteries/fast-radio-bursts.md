category: signals

2007. Astronomers found a 5-millisecond radio burst from outside our galaxy. In that instant: energy equal to days of Sun's output.

Now: Dozens detected per day. Some repeat. Most don't.

**The test:** What must be true for each explanation? Does reality match?

---

## Competing Hypotheses

1. Terrestrial interference
2. Instrumental error
3. Extraterrestrial technology
4. Natural astrophysical phenomenon

---

## H1: Terrestrial Interference

**What must be true:**
- Signal originates on or near Earth
- No dispersion from intergalactic travel
- Single telescope detects (local interference)

**Reality check:**

**Earth origin?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Dispersion measure: Lower frequencies arrive later
- Amount of dispersion = billions of light years travel through intergalactic medium
- Multiple FRBs localized to specific host galaxies
- FRB 121102 traced to galaxy 3 billion light years away
- Cannot fake this dispersion pattern from Earth

**No dispersion?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Clear dispersion signature
- Matches intergalactic medium travel

**Single telescope?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Multiple facilities detect same events
- Independent confirmation

**Score:** 0/3 passes, 3 critical fails
**Result:** Dead. Signals genuinely from deep space.

## H2: Instrumental Error

**What must be true:**
- Single telescope affected
- No correlation with known sources
- Random occurrence pattern

**Reality check:**

**Single telescope?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Multiple independent facilities
- Same dispersion signatures
- Coordinated observations confirm

**No source correlation?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Some FRBs traced to specific galaxies
- Locations match star-forming regions

**Random pattern?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Some FRBs repeat from same location (FRB 121102)
- Consistent physical properties

**Score:** 0/3 passes, 3 critical fails
**Result:** Dead. Not instrumental.

---

## H3: Extraterrestrial Technology

**What must be true:**
- Energy output achievable by technology
- Information content or modulation
- Correlation with habitable zones
- Repeating signals (if beacon)
- Single source type (if engineered)

**Reality check:**

**Energy achievable?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- 10^36 - 10^40 joules in milliseconds
- Far beyond any known civilization's capability
- Requires star-level energy in milliseconds

**Information content?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- Broadband bursts
- No modulation suggesting encoding
- No structure beyond natural dispersion
- Nothing suggests artificial signal

**Habitable correlation?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- Found near star-forming regions
- No correlation with expected habitable zones
- Wrong locations for deliberate communication

**Repeating beacons?** → ✗ FAIL
- Most FRBs: one-time events
- If beacons, would repeat consistently
- Only some repeat

**Single type?** → ✗ FAIL
- Repeaters vs non-repeaters have different properties
- Suggests multiple source types
- Not consistent with single technology

**Score:** 0/5 passes, 2 major + 3 fails
**Result:** Heavily damaged. No positive evidence, multiple problems.

## H4: Natural Astrophysical Phenomenon

**What must be true:**
- Correlation with extreme stellar objects
- Energy and duration match known processes
- At least one source type identified
- Locations match natural expectations
- No information content necessary

**Reality check:**

**Extreme objects?** → ✓ PASS
- Must come from compact object (millisecond pulses require small size)
- Neutron stars, magnetars, black hole vicinity
- Matches expectations

**Energy/duration match?** → ✓ PASS
- Magnetars produce extreme magnetic reconnection events
- Neutron star collapse/merger produces similar energy
- Millisecond timescales consistent with compact objects

**Source identified?** → ✓ PASS - **CRITICAL**
- **April 2020: FRB detected from magnetar SGR 1935+2154 in our galaxy**
- First FRB associated with known object type
- Timing coincided with X-ray burst from same magnetar
- **Proof that natural sources produce FRBs**

**Natural locations?** → ✓ PASS
- Found in star-forming regions
- Consistent with young neutron star / magnetar formation
- Spatial distribution makes sense

**No information needed?** → ✓ PASS
- Broadband bursts
- Matches expectations for explosive events
- No encoding necessary

**Multiple mechanisms?** → ✓ PASS
- Repeaters vs non-repeaters
- Suggests different natural phenomena
- Some catastrophic (one-time), some ongoing (repeaters)

**Score:** 6/6 passes
Calculation: 100% × (1 - 0) = **100%**

## Comparison

| Hypothesis | Score | Critical Failures |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| **Natural (magnetars/neutron stars)** | **100%** | **0** |
| ET technology | ~15% | 0 (but heavy damage) |
| Instrumental error | 0% | 3 |
| Terrestrial | 0% | 3 |

**Winner:** Natural sources. Magnetar proof decisive.

## What This Means

**FRBs seemed inexplicable in 2007.** Now we have working model:

**April 2020 was the decisive moment:** Magnetar in our galaxy produced FRB. Natural source confirmed.

**The pattern:**
- Extreme magnetic events on neutron stars
- Some catastrophic (one-time)
- Some repeating (ongoing activity)
- Billions across observable universe
- We detect ~1,000+ per day

**ET hypothesis not eliminated but has zero supporting evidence:**
- Wrong energy scale
- Wrong locations
- No information content
- Natural explanation confirmed

Sometimes science solves mysteries. FRBs: mostly solved.

**Confidence:** Very high (magnetar proof + perfect fit)
**Status:** Natural astrophysical sources confirmed
**Primary mechanism:** Magnetars and extreme neutron star events
