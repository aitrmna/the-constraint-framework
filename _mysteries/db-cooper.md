description: November 1971. Jumped with $200,000. Vanished completely.
result: Cannot eliminate — died in the jump
category: historical
---

November 24, 1971. A man calling himself Dan Cooper hijacked Northwest Orient Flight 305, extorted $200,000 and four parachutes, then jumped into a freezing rainstorm over the Pacific Northwest wilderness.

He was never found. Neither was most of the money.

53 years. No confirmed identity. No body. No resolution.

## CONSTRAINT STACKING ANALYSIS

**CLAIM:** What happened to D.B. Cooper?

**STARTING SOLUTION SPACE:**
- Survived and escaped
- Died in the jump
- Never existed (elaborate hoax)

---

### CONSTRAINT 1 (MOST DAMNING): The Jump Conditions

**Evidence:**
- Temperature: -7°C (19°F) with wind chill far below zero
- Wind: 200+ mph slipstream from 727 at deployment
- Time: 8:13 PM — complete darkness
- Weather: Heavy freezing rain
- Terrain: Dense forest, mountains, rough terrain
- Equipment: Business suit, loafers, trench coat, no helmet, no reserve chute
- One of the parachutes he chose was a training dummy (sewn shut, non-functional) — he didn't know

**What this means:** Cooper jumped into near-unsurvivable conditions wearing completely inadequate clothing and equipment.

**For survival to be true:**
- He survived -7°C in a business suit
- He landed safely in complete darkness in dense forest
- He navigated out of wilderness in freezing rain at night
- He did this as a first-time jumper (his technique and questions suggested amateur)

**Assessment:** Military-trained skydivers with proper equipment would struggle with this jump. Cooper had neither training indicators nor equipment.

**ELIMINATES:** Dramatically reduces probability of survival — but doesn't fully eliminate it

---

### CONSTRAINT 2: No Confirmed Post-Jump Evidence of Life

**Evidence:**
- No confirmed sighting of Cooper after the jump
- No credible evidence he spent the money
- No deathbed confession verified
- Dozens of suspects investigated — none confirmed
- FBI investigated for 45 years (closed 2016) — no identification

**What this means:** If Cooper survived and escaped with $200,000, he left zero trace for 53 years.

**For survival to be true:**
- He never spent money in traceable way
- He never told anyone (or they never talked)
- He never made a mistake in 53 years
- He evaded the largest FBI manhunt of its era

**Assessment:** Possible, but requires extraordinary discipline across decades.

**ELIMINATES:** Weakens survival hypothesis significantly

---

### CONSTRAINT 3: The Money — Tina Bar Discovery

**Evidence:**
- February 1980: Boy finds $5,800 in rotting $20 bills on Columbia River bank (Tina Bar)
- Serial numbers match Cooper ransom
- Money was degraded, buried in sand
- Location is on potential flight path, near river

**What this means:** Some money ended up in the river system. How?

**Possible explanations:**
- Cooper died in/near water, money scattered
- Cooper buried money, river erosion exposed it
- Cooper (or accomplice) deliberately disposed of money

**Assessment:**
- FBI analysis: Money was NOT buried by human hands — deposited by water action
- Suggests money entered water upstream, washed to Tina Bar
- Consistent with body/bag landing in or near water

**ELIMINATES:** Weakens "successful escape with money" hypothesis

---

### CONSTRAINT 4: The Flight Path Analysis

**Evidence:**
- Jump zone estimated based on pressure bump recorded when aft stairs deployed
- Zone covers rough terrain between Ariel, WA and the Columbia River
- Extensive ground searches found nothing
- Some analysts dispute exact jump location

**What this means:** We don't know exactly where he landed. The terrain is vast and dense.

**For survival:**
- Uncertainty helps — he could have landed somewhere more survivable

**For death:**
- Body in dense forest might never be found
- If he landed in water, body would wash away

**Assessment:** Neither conclusively proven by search failure

**ELIMINATES:** Nothing — explains why both outcomes leave no body

---

### CONSTRAINT 5: The Amateur Indicators

**Evidence:**
- Chose NB6 parachute (older, less steerable) over newer NB8
- Chose dummy training chute as reserve (sewn shut)
- Asked crew how to operate aft stairs
- Jump technique questions suggested inexperience
- Didn't request better equipment despite having leverage

**What this means:** If Cooper was an experienced skydiver, he made strange choices. If amateur, the choices make sense — he didn't know better.

**For survival:**
- An amateur surviving this jump is less likely than expert

**Assessment:** Amateur + terrible conditions + poor equipment = low survival probability

**ELIMINATES:** Further reduces survival probability

---

### CONSTRAINT 6: No Body Found

**Evidence:**
- Extensive searches of suspected drop zone
- 53 years of hikers, hunters, loggers in the area
- No remains ever found
- No parachute found

**What this means:** 

**For survival:** He walked out, proving he lived

**For death:** Body decomposed in wilderness, scattered by animals, or sank in water. Not unusual — remains are often never found in dense forest.

**Assessment:** Absence of body doesn't confirm survival. Many people disappear in Pacific Northwest wilderness permanently.

**ELIMINATES:** Nothing definitively

---

## THE BALANCE

**For survival:**
- No body found
- Money not fully recovered
- Someone planned this carefully enough to execute the hijacking

**For death:**
- Jump conditions near-unsurvivable
- Amateur indicators
- No post-jump evidence of life
- Money found in river (suggests he didn't keep it)
- 53 years of silence

---

## RESULT

| Hypothesis | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Survived and escaped | Possible but requires extraordinary luck + discipline |
| **Died in the jump** | **Cannot eliminate — most consistent with evidence** |
| Elaborate hoax | ❌ Eliminated (FBI confirmed real hijacking, real jump) |

---

## What This Means

We are not saying "D.B. Cooper definitely died."

We are saying: "A man jumped into -7°C darkness in a business suit with amateur equipment. No confirmed evidence of his survival exists despite 53 years of investigation. Money was found deposited by water, not human burial. The constraints favor death over survival, but neither can be fully eliminated."

The romanticism of a perfect escape is appealing. The evidence points toward a man who died alone in the freezing dark, his body never recovered from the wilderness.

Sometimes the mundane explanation survives.
