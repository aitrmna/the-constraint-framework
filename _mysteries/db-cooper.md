November 24, 1971. A man calling himself Dan Cooper hijacked Northwest Orient Flight 305, extorted $200,000 and four parachutes, then jumped into a freezing rainstorm over Pacific Northwest wilderness at 8:13 PM.

53 years. No body. No confirmed identity. No resolution.

**The test:** What must be true if he survived? Does reality match?

## Competing Hypotheses

1. Survived and escaped
2. Died in the jump

---

## H1: Survived and Escaped

**What must be true:**
- Survived -7°C in business suit
- Landed safely in complete darkness in dense forest
- Navigated out of freezing wilderness at night
- Kept all money or hid it successfully
- Never spent money traceably in 53 years
- Never told anyone (or they never talked)
- Evaded FBI manhunt for decades

**Reality check:**

**Survived conditions?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- Temperature: -7°C with wind chill far below zero
- 200+ mph slipstream at deployment
- Business suit, loafers, trench coat
- No helmet, no proper equipment
- Amateur indicators (asked how to operate stairs, chose sewn-shut dummy chute as reserve)
- Military skydivers with proper gear would struggle with this

**Landed safely?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- Complete darkness (8:13 PM)
- Heavy freezing rain
- Dense forest and mountains
- First-time jumper (technique suggested amateur)

**Kept money?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- 1980: $5,800 found at Tina Bar, Columbia River
- Serial numbers matched ransom
- FBI analysis: deposited by water action, not buried by human
- Suggests money/bag landed in or near water

**Never spent it?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- $200,000 in 1971 = substantial sum
- No bills traced to circulation
- 53 years without spending traceable money requires extraordinary discipline

**Never told anyone?** → ⚠️ UNCLEAR
- Possible but requires perfect operational security for 53 years
- Multiple "confessions" investigated, none verified

**Evaded FBI?** → ✗ MAJOR FAIL
- Largest manhunt of era
- Dozens of suspects investigated
- FBI closed case 2016 (no identification)
- Zero confirmed evidence of survival

**Score:** 0/7 passes, 5 major fails, 1 unclear
Calculation: 0% × (1 - 0.21) ≈ **0%**

Adjusted for some possibility: **~5%** (not impossible, just extremely unlikely)

## H2: Died in the Jump

**What must be true:**
- Jump conditions unsurvivable for amateur in business suit
- No post-jump evidence expected if dead
- Money could scatter if body landed near water
- Body might never be found in dense wilderness
- Amateur choices consistent with someone who wouldn't survive

**Reality check:**

**Unsurvivable conditions?** → ✓ PASS
- -7°C, freezing rain, darkness, 200+ mph deployment
- Business suit and loafers
- Amateur indicators (chose dummy chute, asked basic questions)
- Dense forest landing zone

**No evidence expected?** → ✓ PASS
- Dead person leaves no trace
- FBI manhunt finding nothing consistent with death
- 53 years of silence consistent with death

**Money could scatter?** → ✓ PASS
- $5,800 found at Tina Bar deposited by water
- FBI: not buried by human hands
- Suggests bag/body near water, money washed downstream

**Body never found?** → ✓ PASS
- Dense Pacific Northwest wilderness
- Bodies often never found in this terrain
- Animal scattering, decomposition
- Possible water landing (body washed away)

**Amateur choices?** → ✓ PASS
- Chose older NB6 over better NB8 parachute
- Took sewn-shut dummy chute as reserve
- Asked crew basic questions
- Didn't request proper equipment despite leverage
- All consistent with someone unprepared to survive

**Score:** 5/5 passes
Calculation: 100% × (1 - 0) = **100%**

Adjusted for slight possibility of survival: **~95%**

## Comparison

| Hypothesis | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| **Died in jump** | **95%** |
| Survived | 5% |

**Advantage:** 95% / 5% = **19:1** (rounds to **20:1**)

## What This Means

**The romantic story:** Perfect escape, living on beach somewhere with the money.

**Reality constraints:**
- Amateur jumped in -7°C darkness wearing business suit
- Money found in river (not spent, not buried)
- 53 years, zero confirmed evidence of survival
- FBI found nothing in largest manhunt of era

**Every prediction for survival fails. Every prediction for death passes.**

This isn't certainty. A 5% chance means ~1 in 20. Possible but unlikely.

**The evidence favors:** A man who died alone in the freezing dark, body lost in wilderness or river, most money never recovered.

Sometimes the mundane answer survives.

---

**Confidence:** High (20:1 advantage)
**Most likely:** Died in or shortly after the jump
**Cannot eliminate:** Extremely unlikely survival scenario
