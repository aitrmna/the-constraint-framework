description: Daily encounters, Pentagon-released videos
result: Insufficient data for strong conclusion

---

2014-2015. US Navy pilots from USS Theodore Roosevelt encountered unidentified objects almost daily during training exercises off the East Coast. Two videos — "Gimbal" and "GoFast" — were officially released by the Pentagon. Pilots testified to Congress about sustained encounters.

**Limited released data makes strong conclusions difficult.**

## THE MYSTERY

**Core Question:** What did Navy pilots encounter off Virginia coast 2014-2015?

**Available Evidence:**
- Pentagon-released "Gimbal" and "GoFast" videos
- Pilot testimony (some public, some classified)
- Reports of daily encounters over 2+ years
- Navy changed UAP reporting procedures
- Congressional testimony under oath

**Data Limitations:**
- Only 2 short videos publicly released
- Most sensor data remains classified
- Radar data not publicly available
- Full pilot testimony not public

## COMPETING HYPOTHESES

**H1: Balloons**
- Weather balloons or party balloons
- Drift patterns explain movement

**H2: Drones**
- Consumer or commercial drones
- Illegally operating in military airspace

**H3: Camera Artifacts**
- ATFLIR system creates visual effects
- Gimbal rotation, glare effects

**H4: Foreign Technology**
- Russia/China testing near US carrier
- Advanced but human-made

**H5: Secret US Tech**
- Classified US program testing
- In operational environment

**H6: Non-Human Technology**
- Beyond current human capability

## PREDICTIONS & TESTING

### H1: Balloons

**Predictions:**

1. **Drift with wind** → ⚠️ **UNCLEAR**
   - Pilots claim stationary in 120kt winds
   - Can't verify from video alone
   - Needs full sensor data

2. **Identifiable as balloons** → ✗ **FAIL**
   - Navy pilots would recognize balloons
   - Filed safety reports (indicates genuine concern)

3. **No radar returns** → ✗ **FAIL**
   - Prediction: Balloons don't show on radar well
   - Observation: Pilots report radar tracks

**Score:** 0/3 with 1 unclear
**Preliminary Fit:** **~20%** (possible but unlikely)

---

### H2: Drones

**Predictions:**

1. **Daily pattern makes sense** → ✓ **PASS**
   - Someone could fly drones repeatedly
   - Training area is known, accessible

2. **Navy would identify** → ✗ **FAIL**
   - Navy familiar with drones
   - Wouldn't label "unidentified"

3. **Investigation/arrests** → ✗ **FAIL**
   - Illegal drone operations near carrier
   - No arrests or warnings issued

**Score:** 1/3
**Preliminary Fit:** **~30%**

---

### H3: Camera Artifacts

**Predictions:**

1. **Navy would recognize** → ✗ **CRITICAL FAIL**
   - Navy uses ATFLIR daily
   - Would know own sensor artifacts

2. **No radar confirmation** → ✗ **FAIL**
   - If just camera, no radar
   - Pilots report radar tracks

3. **Inconsistent appearances** → ✗ **FAIL**
   - Artifacts vary randomly
   - Pilots report consistent objects

**Score:** 0/3
**Preliminary Fit:** **~5%**

---

### H4-H6: Advanced Technology (Foreign/US/Non-Human)

**Cannot differentiate without more data:**
- All predict: Radar + visual confirmation ✓
- All predict: Navy can't identify ✓
- All predict: Consistent appearances ✓
- All predict: Performance beyond typical aircraft ⚠️

**Key question:** Performance capabilities
- If extreme (Tic Tac level): Suggests non-human
- If moderate: Could be foreign/US
- **Problem:** Performance data not publicly released

**Preliminary assessment:**
- Foreign tech: ~15% (why test openly near US carrier for 2 years?)
- US secret tech: ~10% (why confuse own pilots for 2 years?)
- Non-human tech: ~20% (consistent with other UAP patterns)

---

## THE DATA PROBLEM

**What we need but don't have:**
- Full radar data (speeds, accelerations)
- Complete pilot testimony (not just clips)
- Multi-sensor correlation details
- Technical analysis from Navy

**What prevents strong conclusion:**
- Two short videos insufficient
- Most data classified
- Can't rule out mundane explanations definitively
- Can't confirm extraordinary performance

**This is NOT like Tic Tac:**
- Tic Tac: Full sensor suite data, clear physics calculations
- Gimbal/GoFast: Limited released data, can't calculate performance

---

## COMPARATIVE SCORES (Preliminary)

| Hypothesis | Fit | Confidence |
|-----------|-----|------------|
| Drones | 30% | Low (weak explanation) |
| Non-Human Tech | 20% | Very Low (insufficient data) |
| Balloons | 20% | Low (unlikely but not eliminated) |
| Foreign Tech | 15% | Low (implausible behavior) |
| US Secret Tech | 10% | Very Low (odd to confuse own pilots) |
| Camera Artifacts | 5% | Very Low (Navy would know) |

**No clear winner. Evidence insufficient.**

**Advantage Ratio:** 1.5:1 (drones vs next best)
**Interpretation:** Too close to call

---

## WHAT THIS CASE SHOWS

**The framework working honestly:**

When evidence is insufficient, framework says "insufficient evidence."

**Not every UAP case is strong:**
- Tic Tac: Overwhelming data, clear conclusion
- Belgian Wave: Data collapses under scrutiny
- **Gimbal/GoFast: Limited data, no strong conclusion**

**This is appropriate epistemic humility.**

**What would resolve it:**
- Release full radar data
- Release performance calculations
- Declassify pilot testimony
- Multi-sensor analysis

**Until then:** Cannot make strong claim either direction.

---

## HONEST ASSESSMENT

**Most likely scenario given available data:**
Some combination of:
- Drones (some encounters)
- Camera effects (some appearances)
- Unknown objects (some genuine anomalies)

**Without full data, cannot determine which encounters are which.**

**This is a weak case for extraordinary claims.**

**Confidence:** Low across all hypotheses
