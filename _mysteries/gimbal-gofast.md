---

2014-2015. US Navy pilots from the USS Theodore Roosevelt encountered unidentified objects almost daily during training exercises off the East Coast. Two videos — "Gimbal" and "GoFast" — were recorded using F/A-18 targeting systems. These were among the three videos officially released by the Pentagon in 2020.

## EVIDENCE CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS

This case demonstrates **MODERATE-HIGH convergence** — persistent observations but weaker individual event data than Tic Tac.

### Axioms Applied

**✓ Boundary Conservation (STRONG)**
- Restricted military airspace = clear boundary
- Training zones precisely defined
- Objects repeatedly appeared within same boundaries
- Verdict: Strong spatial containment

**✓ Irreversibility (STRONG)**
- ATFLIR video recordings (permanent)
- Official Navy safety reports filed (permanent)
- Congressional testimony (permanent record)
- Pentagon video release (irreversible disclosure)
- Verdict: Multiple irreversible artifacts

**⚠️ Convergence Supremacy (MODERATE)**
- Multiple pilots over 2 years (independent observations)
- BUT: Many observations not instrumentally recorded
- Only 2 videos released publicly (small sample from larger set)
- Verdict: High witness count but limited hard evidence released

**✓ Gradient Navigation (STRONG)**
- Daily encounters over years = sustained gradient
- Objects appeared → disappeared → reappeared (clear temporal patterns)
- Training operations disrupted (measurable impact)
- Verdict: Strong sustained signal

**⚠️ Bottleneck Traceability (MODERATE)**
- ATFLIR targeting pod is mandatory for F/A-18 weapon systems
- Objects passed through sensor bottleneck
- But: No radar data released publicly, limited to FLIR
- Verdict: Some bottlenecks confirmed, others not disclosed

**⚠️ State-Change Amplification (MODERATE)**
- Objects holding in 120kt winds = high energy expenditure
- But: No extreme accelerations captured on released footage
- Gradual not dramatic events
- Verdict: Sustained performance but not peak dramatic events

### Evidence Nodes (scored 0-10)

1. **Daily encounters for 2+ years** — 8/10
   - Lt. Graves testimony: "every day for at least a couple years"
   - Multiple pilots corroborate
   - Sustained pattern rules out isolated anomalies

2. **Gimbal ATFLIR video** — 7/10
   - Pentagon-authenticated footage
   - Object tracked, thermal signature
   - No visible propulsion
   - Rotation may be artifact but object presence confirmed

3. **GoFast ATFLIR video** — 5/10
   - Pentagon-authenticated
   - Parallax debate reduces certainty
   - Object present but performance disputed

4. **120kt wind hover capability** — 7/10
   - Multiple pilot testimony
   - No video confirmation of this specific claim
   - But consistent across reports

5. **Radar confirmation (pilot reports)** — 6/10
   - Pilots report radar tracks
   - Near-miss incident documented
   - But: No radar data released publicly

6. **Navy safety reports filed** — 8/10
   - Official documentation
   - Navy changed UAP reporting procedures
   - Institutional response indicates seriousness

7. **Congressional testimony** — 7/10
   - Pilots testified under oath
   - Public hearings in 2022-2023
   - But: Limited new evidence presented

### Independence Check

- Gimbal video ↔ GoFast video: Different events, different timeframes ✓
- Pilot testimony ↔ ATFLIR footage: Different evidence types ✓
- Multiple pilots ↔ Each other: Different individuals ✓

**But:** All from same carrier group, same geographic area. Limited platform independence.

### Convergence Score

**7 nodes × 6.9 average = 48/100**

**Confidence bracket:** Moderate (40-59 range)

**Interpretation:** This case sits in ambiguous middle ground:
- Stronger than single-witness accounts (sustained observations, multiple pilots)
- Weaker than multi-sensor cases (limited instrumentation released)
- Pattern is compelling (daily for years) but individual events less documented

### Critical Comparison

| Case | Score | Key Difference |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Tic Tac | 60/100 | Single event, multi-sensor, extreme calculated performance |
| **Gimbal/GoFast** | **48/100** | **Sustained pattern, limited sensors released** |
| Rendlesham | 39/100 | Multi-night, audio recording, low-energy traces |

**Why lower than Tic Tac despite more encounters?**
- Tic Tac had radar + FLIR + visual all converging on single dramatic event
- Gimbal/GoFast has many observations but limited hard evidence released
- Quality vs quantity trade-off

**The 48/100 score suggests:** Something anomalous occurred repeatedly, but public evidence is incomplete. Higher-quality data likely exists but remains classified.

## CONSTRAINT STACKING ANALYSIS

**CLAIM:** What were the Gimbal and GoFast objects?

**STARTING SOLUTION SPACE:**
- Sensor artifact / glare
- Drone (foreign or domestic)
- Balloon
- Bird
- Conventional aircraft
- Electronic warfare spoofing
- Non-human technology

---

### CONSTRAINT 1 (MOST DAMNING): Pilot Testimony — "A Whole Fleet of Them"

**Evidence:**
- Lt. Ryan Graves: Objects encountered "every day for at least a couple years" off Virginia coast
- Multiple pilots reported objects holding stationary in 120+ knot winds, then accelerating rapidly
- Gimbal audio: "There's a whole fleet of them... look at that thing, it's rotating!"
- GoFast audio: Pilots express amazement at object speed close to water
- Lt. Cmdr. Dietrich, Lt. Accoin, and others went on record with consistent accounts

**What this means:** Not a single anomalous encounter. Persistent presence over years, witnessed by multiple pilots.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ One-off sensor glitch (daily for years)
- ❌ Single witness error (multiple pilots, different squadrons)

**Remaining:** Physical objects present in training airspace for extended period

---

### CONSTRAINT 2: Gimbal Video — Object Rotation

**Evidence:**
- ATFLIR targeting pod video (official Pentagon release)
- Object appears to rotate while maintaining flight path
- No wings, no exhaust plume visible
- Pilots audibly confused: "Look at that thing!"
- Object tracked in infrared (heat signature present)

**What this means:** Object is warm (not balloon), has no visible propulsion, rotates independently of flight direction.

**Skeptic claim:** "Rotation is gimbal artifact from camera system"

**Response:** 
- The *rotation* might be artifact
- The *object itself* — tracked, warm, no exhaust, maintaining position in strong winds — is not explained by camera artifact
- Pilots were confused by the object, not the camera

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Camera glare (has heat signature, tracked across sky)
- ❌ Conventional aircraft (no wings, no exhaust)

**Remaining:** Unconventional object with unusual flight characteristics

---

### CONSTRAINT 3: GoFast Video — Speed and Altitude

**Evidence:**
- ATFLIR video shows object moving fast over water
- No wings visible
- Parallax analysis debates actual speed (some say fast, some say slower with parallax illusion)

**The debate:**
- Skeptics: Parallax makes a slower object look fast
- Pilots: Object was remarkable enough to record and exclaim over

**PARTIALLY CONSTRAINS:**
- ⚠️ GoFast alone is weaker evidence due to parallax debate
- ⚠️ But GoFast is part of a pattern, not isolated incident

**Remaining:** Object of some kind present; speed disputed

---

### CONSTRAINT 4: Radar Corroboration

**Evidence:**
- Lt. Graves reported objects appeared on radar
- Near-miss incident: Pilot almost collided with object (radar and visual)
- Official Navy safety reports filed
- Navy changed reporting procedures because of these encounters

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Pure optical illusion (radar confirmed physical objects)
- ❌ Birds (radar return too strong, speeds too high)

**Remaining:** Physical objects with radar signature

---

### CONSTRAINT 5: Performance — Stationary in 120kt Winds

**Evidence:**
- Pilots reported objects holding stationary position in high winds
- Then accelerating rapidly
- No visible propulsion
- This happened repeatedly over months/years

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Balloon (would drift with wind)
- ❌ Conventional drone (consumer drones can't hold position in 120kt winds)
- ❌ Military drone (no US drone disclosed with these capabilities; would not operate uncoordinated in training airspace)

**Remaining:** Unknown technology capable of wind-independent hover and rapid acceleration

---

### CONSTRAINT 6: Location — Active Military Training Zone

**Evidence:**
- Objects appeared in restricted military airspace
- Daily presence disrupted training operations
- Navy filed official UAP safety reports
- Navy eventually briefed Congress on encounters

**What this means:** Unknown objects operated persistently in sovereign military airspace without clearance.

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Domestic secret test (wouldn't operate uncoordinated in training zones for years)
- ❌ Casual misidentification (Navy took it seriously enough to change procedures and brief Congress)

**Remaining:** Unknown origin, not coordinated with US military

---

### CONSTRAINT 7: Official Confirmation

**Evidence:**
- Pentagon officially released videos (2020)
- Confirmed videos are authentic Navy footage
- Navy confirmed objects remain "unidentified"
- Pilots testified to Congress (2022, 2023)

**ELIMINATES:**
- ❌ Hoax (Pentagon authenticated)
- ❌ Classified US program (Navy would know; wouldn't release video and claim "unidentified")

---

## ANOMALIES

**"Why release the videos if it's really unknown?"**
→ Videos leaked first; Pentagon confirmed authenticity rather than deny. Possibly forced disclosure.

**"Why no clear high-resolution footage?"**
→ ATFLIR is designed for targeting, not photography. What we see is what the system captures. Better footage may exist but remain classified.

**"Why didn't they shoot one down?"**
→ No hostile action by objects. Shooting unidentified objects in domestic airspace has massive risk if wrong.

All anomalies fit within remaining solution space.

## RESULT

| Hypothesis | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Sensor artifact | ❌ Eliminated |
| Balloon | ❌ Eliminated |
| Bird | ❌ Eliminated |
| Conventional drone | ❌ Eliminated |
| Secret US program | ❌ Eliminated |
| Foreign drone | ⚠️ Cannot fully eliminate (but no known capability matches) |
| **Non-human technology** | **Cannot eliminate** |

## What This Means

We are not saying "the Gimbal and GoFast objects were non-human technology."

We are saying: "Objects were present daily for years in military airspace. They appeared on radar, were witnessed by multiple pilots, demonstrated unusual flight characteristics, and remain officially unidentified. The Pentagon released the videos and confirmed they don't know what they are. Non-human technology cannot be eliminated."

The weaker case of the three Pentagon videos — but part of a larger pattern that makes the overall evidence stronger.
