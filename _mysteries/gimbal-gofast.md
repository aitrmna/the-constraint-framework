result: Insufficient data - cannot eliminate mundane explanations

---

2014-2015. Navy pilots from USS Theodore Roosevelt encountered unidentified objects almost daily during training off Virginia coast. Pentagon released two videos ("Gimbal" and "GoFast"). Pilots testified to Congress.

**Limited released data prevents strong conclusions.**

**The test:** What must be true for each explanation? Can we check with available data?

---

## The Data Problem

**What we have:**
- Two short Pentagon-released videos
- Public pilot testimony (limited)
- Confirmation of daily encounters over 2+ years
- Navy changed UAP reporting procedures

**What we don't have:**
- Full radar data (speeds, accelerations)
- Complete sensor suite information
- Classified pilot testimony
- Performance calculations

**This is NOT like Tic Tac:**
- Tic Tac: Full multi-sensor data, clear physics calculations, precise performance numbers
- Gimbal/GoFast: Two short videos, most data classified

**Result: Cannot make strong claims either direction.**

---

## Competing Hypotheses

1. Balloons (weather or party balloons)
2. Drones (consumer/commercial)
3. Camera artifacts (ATFLIR glare/rotation)
4. Foreign technology
5. Secret US technology
6. Non-human technology

## H1: Balloons

**What must be true:**
- Drift with wind
- Navy pilots would recognize
- Wouldn't show on radar

**Reality check:**

**Drift with wind?** → ⚠️ UNCLEAR
- Pilots claim stationary in 120kt winds
- Cannot verify from video alone
- Need full sensor data

**Navy recognizes?** → ✗ FAIL
- Navy pilots know what balloons look like
- Filed safety reports (indicates genuine concern)

**No radar?** → ✗ FAIL
- Balloons typically don't radar well
- Pilots report radar tracks

**Score:** 0/3 passes, 1 unclear
**Fit:** ~20% (possible but unlikely)

**Problem:** Can't definitively eliminate without full data.

---

## H2: Drones

**What must be true:**
- Someone flying them repeatedly (daily for 2 years)
- Navy wouldn't identify as drones
- No investigation/arrests despite illegal operation

**Reality check:**

**Daily pattern?** → ✓ PASS
- Training area known and accessible
- Someone could fly repeatedly

**Navy wouldn't identify?** → ✗ FAIL
- Navy familiar with drones
- Wouldn't label "unidentified" if obviously drones

**No arrests?** → ✗ FAIL
- Illegal drone operations near carrier
- No warnings or arrests issued
- 2+ years of daily violations with no enforcement?

**Score:** 1/3 passes
**Fit:** ~30%

**Problem:** Why no investigation of illegal flights?

---

## H3: Camera Artifacts

**What must be true:**
- Navy wouldn't recognize own sensor effects
- No radar confirmation (just visual artifact)
- Inconsistent appearances (artifacts vary)

**Reality check:**

**Navy wouldn't recognize?** → ✗ CRITICAL FAIL
- Navy uses ATFLIR daily
- Trained to recognize sensor artifacts
- Wouldn't file reports for known effects

**No radar?** → ✗ FAIL
- If just camera artifact, no radar returns
- Pilots report radar tracks

**Inconsistent?** → ✗ FAIL
- Sensor artifacts vary randomly
- Pilots report consistent objects over time

**Score:** 0/3 passes, 1 critical fail
**Fit:** ~5%

**Result:** Navy would know their own sensors. This doesn't survive.

---

## H4-H6: Advanced Technology

**Cannot differentiate without performance data.**

All three (foreign/US/non-human) predict:
- Radar + visual confirmation → ✓ (reported)
- Navy can't identify → ✓ (correct)
- Consistent appearances → ✓ (reported)
- Performance beyond typical → ⚠️ (unknown - data classified)

**The key question:** How did these objects perform?
- If Tic Tac-level (175g+ acceleration, no heat signature) → Non-human likely
- If moderate performance → Could be foreign/US
- **Problem:** Performance data not released

**Provisional scores without performance data:**

**Foreign tech:** ~15%
- Why test openly near US carrier for 2 years?
- Why no response if adversary violating airspace daily?

**US secret tech:** ~10%
- Why confuse own pilots for 2+ years?
- Why change reporting procedures for own tech?

**Non-human tech:** ~20%
- Consistent with other UAP patterns
- But: insufficient data to confirm extraordinary performance

## Comparison

| Hypothesis | Fit | Data Quality |
|-----------|-----|--------------|
| Drones | 30% | Low confidence |
| Non-human tech | 20% | Insufficient data |
| Balloons | 20% | Low confidence |
| Foreign tech | 15% | Low confidence |
| US tech | 10% | Low confidence |
| Camera artifacts | 5% | Can eliminate |

**Advantage:** 1.5:1 (drones vs next best)

**Interpretation:** Too close to call. Evidence insufficient.

## What This Case Shows

**The framework being honest:**

When data is insufficient, the framework says: **"Insufficient data."**

**Not every UAP case is strong:**
- **Tic Tac:** Overwhelming multi-sensor data → Clear conclusion (78% non-human)
- **Belgian Wave:** Data collapses under scrutiny → Clear conclusion (0% extraordinary)
- **Gimbal/GoFast:** Limited data → No clear conclusion

**This is appropriate epistemic humility.**

---

## What Would Resolve It

**Release the following:**
- Full radar data with performance calculations
- Complete multi-sensor correlation analysis
- Declassified pilot testimony
- Technical Navy analysis

**Until then:** Cannot claim extraordinary objects with confidence.
**But also:** Cannot eliminate extraordinary objects.

**Honest answer:** We don't have enough data.

---

## Most Likely (Given Limited Data)

Some combination of:
- Drones (some encounters)
- Camera effects (some appearances)
- Unknown objects (some genuine anomalies)

**Cannot determine which encounters are which without full data.**

**This is NOT a strong case for extraordinary claims.**

**But it's also NOT a debunked case like Belgian Wave.**

It's an **unresolved case with insufficient public data.**

---

**Status:** Insufficient data for strong conclusion
**Confidence:** Low across all hypotheses
**Best mundane fit:** Drones at 30%
**Best exotic fit:** Non-human at 20%
**Gap:** Too small to differentiate (1.5:1)

**Contrast with Tic Tac (15:1 advantage) and Belgian Wave (infinite advantage).**

The framework differentiates between strong cases, weak cases, and insufficient-data cases.
