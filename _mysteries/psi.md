If "separation is appearance" and awareness is fundamental, minds shouldn't be fully isolated. Information should be able to pass between them, or awareness should be able to access distant information.

This is what psi research claims to find. The evidence is contested. Let's look.

## CONSTRAINT STACKING ANALYSIS

**CLAIM BEING TESTED:** Psi is not real (minds are informationally isolated)

---

### CONSTRAINT 1: The Ganzfeld Experiments

**Evidence:**
- Receiver in sensory deprivation, sender views target image
- Receiver describes impressions, then ranks four images including target
- Chance = 25%. Meta-analyses show ~32% hit rate.
- Effect is small but statistically significant across many studies
- Bem & Honorton (1994), later replications

**Problem for "psi is fake":** Hit rate consistently above chance across multiple labs.

**Skeptic response:** 
- File drawer problem (failed studies not published)
- Sensory leakage in early studies
- Effect has shrunk over time as controls tightened

**Assessment:** Effect exists but is small and sensitive to conditions. Not zero, but not robust.

---

### CONSTRAINT 2: Remote Viewing (Stargate Program)

**Evidence:**
- CIA funded remote viewing research 1972-1995
- Viewers attempted to describe distant targets using only coordinates
- Some sessions produced strikingly accurate descriptions
- Program ran for 23 years — unusual if completely useless
- Final evaluation: "statistically significant effect" but "not useful for intelligence"

**Problem for "psi is fake":** CIA wouldn't fund nonsense for 23 years. Some hits were remarkable.

**Skeptic response:**
- Hits cherry-picked; misses ignored
- Judging was subjective
- "Not useful" means too unreliable for practical application

**Assessment:** Something was happening, but not reliably enough to be operationally useful. Not zero, not strong.

---

### CONSTRAINT 3: Presentiment Studies

**Evidence:**
- Physiological responses (skin conductance, pupil dilation) measured BEFORE random stimulus
- Dean Radin's studies: Body seems to anticipate emotional images ~2-3 seconds before display
- Effect is small but replicated across multiple labs
- Daryl Bem's "Feeling the Future" (2011) — 9 experiments, 8 showed effect

**Problem for "psi is fake":** Physiological response before stimulus shouldn't happen.

**Skeptic response:**
- Methodological issues (randomization, analysis)
- Replication failures by skeptics
- Effect sizes are tiny

**Assessment:** Contested. Some replications succeed, some fail. Not clearly fake, not clearly robust.

---

### CONSTRAINT 4: The Decline Effect

**Evidence:**
- Psi effects tend to be stronger in early studies, weaker in replications
- As controls tighten, effects shrink
- This pattern appears across psi research

**Problem for "psi is real":** If it's a real phenomenon, why does it diminish under scrutiny?

**Psi proponent response:**
- "Experimenter effect" — skeptical experimenters suppress psi
- Psi is sensitive to conditions (belief, relaxation, novelty)
- Consciousness-related phenomena might not be mechanically reproducible

**Assessment:** This is a genuine problem. Either psi is methodological artifact that disappears under scrutiny, or it's a strange phenomenon that resists controlled study.

---

### CONSTRAINT 5: The Statistical Reality

**Evidence:**
- Meta-analyses of psi research DO show effects above chance
- But effects are small (often d = 0.1-0.3)
- P-values are significant due to large sample sizes
- Effect could be real-but-small or artifact-that-survives

**What this means:** We can't say "psi shows nothing." Something shows up statistically. The question is what.

---

### CONSTRAINT 6: No Proposed Mechanism

**Evidence:**
- No physical mechanism for telepathy, remote viewing, or precognition
- Would require information transfer outside known physics
- Quantum explanations are speculative (Penrose-Hameroff, etc.)

**Problem for "psi is real":** How would it work?

**Response:** If consciousness is fundamental, "mechanism" might be wrong frame. Awareness accessing awareness isn't physical transmission.

**Assessment:** Lack of mechanism is problem for materialists. Less problematic if consciousness is fundamental.

---

## PART 2: Testing "Psi Is Real"

What problems does the pro-psi position face?

### CONSTRAINT 1: Decline Under Scrutiny

As controls tighten, effects shrink. This is exactly what you'd expect from methodological artifact. It's the strongest evidence against genuine psi.

### CONSTRAINT 2: No Reliable Demonstration

No psi proponent has won James Randi's Million Dollar Challenge or similar tests. If psi is real, why can't anyone demonstrate it reliably under controlled conditions?

**Response:** The challenge conditions are hostile, and psi might require receptive conditions.

**Assessment:** Convenient, but possible if psi is consciousness-related.

### CONSTRAINT 3: Extraordinary Claims Burden

Psi would overturn known physics. Extraordinary evidence required. The evidence is statistically significant but not extraordinary.

---

## THE WEIGHING

**For "psi is fake":**
- Decline effect (methodological artifact pattern)
- No reliable demonstration
- No mechanism

**For "psi is real":**
- Statistical effects above chance (meta-analyses)
- 23 years of CIA funding
- Some remarkable individual hits

**Type of evidence:**
- "Psi is fake" relies on: methodological critique, absence of strong demonstration
- "Psi is real" relies on: statistical patterns, some anomalies

Neither side has unexplained anomalies that MUST exist. Both have problems.

---

## RESULT

| Hypothesis | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Psi is completely fake (zero effect) | Doesn't fit — meta-analyses show something |
| Psi is robust and reliable | Doesn't fit — effects shrink under scrutiny |
| **Small effects exist, mechanism unknown** | **Cannot eliminate** |

---

## What This Means for the Pattern

We predicted: If awareness is fundamental and separation is appearance, minds shouldn't be fully isolated. Psi should show SOMETHING.

**What we find:** Small effects that resist explanation. Not nothing. Not robust.

**Interpretation:**
- If psi is real but weak, separation is "mostly appearance" — there IS connection, but it's faint
- If psi is artifact, separation is more real than our model suggests
- The evidence is frustratingly ambiguous

**Honest conclusion:** Psi neither strongly confirms nor refutes "separation is appearance." The effects are too small and contested to bear much weight either direction.

---

## The Deeper Question

Why would psi be weak and unreliable?

If consciousness is fundamental and separation is appearance, you'd expect SOME access between minds. But maybe:
- The separation is functional (awareness individuates for a reason)
- The access is there but hard to operationalize
- "Psi" is the wrong frame — it's not transmission but shared ground

We don't resolve this. But the question is now sharper.
