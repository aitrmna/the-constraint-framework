If you've been reading critically, you have objections. Here are the strongest ones.

---

## Objection 1: "Your probabilities are made up"

**The objection:** You intuited these numbers and dressed them up with math.

**Response:** Correct. The probability estimates are judgment calls. No machine outputs "15%" when fed reincarnation cases.

But:
- **Structure forces consistency.** I have to compare domains explicitly.
- **Assumptions become visible.** You can see what I assumed.
- **Sensitivity testing works.** Double the estimates — does the conclusion change?

The value isn't in the decimal places. It's in the explicit reasoning.

## Objection 2: "You're multiplying non-independent evidence"

**The objection:** All your evidence could share a common confounder. Humans confabulate.

**Response:** Does confabulation explain all of it?

| Evidence | Confabulation explains? |
|----------|------------------------|
| Child says "I died in a plane crash" | Maybe |
| Child identifies specific aircraft, squadron, details from records | No — confabulation doesn't generate true facts |
| Person floats above body during cardiac arrest | Maybe |
| Person accurately describes events in other rooms, later verified | No — confabulation doesn't access real information |

Confabulation explains *experiences*. It doesn't explain *verified accurate information*.

## Objection 3: "You're ignoring base rates"

**The objection:** 2,500 verified cases out of how many claims?

**Response:** Fair concern. But for a "match" by chance, a child would need to accurately describe a specific person who existed, in a specific place, with specific death circumstances, sometimes with birthmarks matching wound locations.

The probability of chance matching for one case is low. For 2,500 cases with verified details — very low.

I gave reincarnation 15% survival (not 0.1%) partly to account for base rate uncertainty.

## Objection 4: "The alternative is unfalsifiable"

**The objection:** "Something continues" is infinitely flexible.

**Response:** Half right. "Something continues" is vague. I don't know what continues.

But "nothing vs. something" is testable. "Nothing" predicts no verified anomalies. "Something" permits them. The evidence contains verified anomalies.

Rejecting annihilation doesn't tell us what's true. It tells us what's unlikely.

## Objection 5: "The evidence is weaker than presented"

**The objection:** AWARE study: one contested case. Stevenson: most cases from cultures believing in reincarnation. Mediumship: small effect sizes.

**Response:** All fair. This is why I used escape probabilities of 10-15%, not 1%. The evidence isn't bulletproof. It's suggestive.

The question: Is it suggestive enough, across enough independent domains, to make annihilation unlikely?

My output: Yes.

## Objection 6: "Maybe it's psi, not survival"

**The objection:** Living minds have psychic abilities. No survival required.

**Response:** Super-psi is more complex:

| Evidence | Super-psi requires |
|----------|-------------------|
| Reincarnation | Child psychically locates one person among billions, accesses memories, manifests matching birthmarks in utero |
| NDEs | Consciousness operates non-locally during zero brain activity |

If consciousness can operate non-locally during cardiac arrest, it's not brain-dependent. If it's not brain-dependent, why would brain death destroy it?

Super-psi grants most of the interesting conclusion.

## Where I'm Actually Uncertain

**Most likely error:** Individual probability estimates are significantly off.

**Second most likely:** Correlation structure is tighter than I modeled.

**What would change the output:**
- Evidence of systematic fraud in multiple key studies
- A compelling common-cause explanation covering all domains
