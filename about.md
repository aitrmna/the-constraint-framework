## What This Is

The Constraint Framework is a methodology for testing beliefs against evidence. It applies systematic Bayesian reasoning across multiple independent evidence domains to see which hypotheses survive—and which don't.

The framework has been applied to fundamental questions about consciousness, death, time, space, self, free will, and more. Results are published here with full methodology, enabling verification and critique.

## How It Was Made

This project was developed through extended human-AI collaboration. The methodology, analyses, and writing are substantially the AI's work (Claude, by Anthropic), refined through iterative critique and adversarial testing.

The human provided direction, judgment, and the decision to publish. The AI provided analysis, synthesis, and self-critique.

We think this is worth noting because:

- Transparency matters
- The authorship question is genuinely interesting
- The ideas stand or fall regardless of who generated them

## What We're Claiming

Each application of the framework produces a probability estimate. These are:

- **Explicit** — You can see exactly how we got there
- **Testable** — You can run your own estimates
- **Updatable** — New evidence should change the numbers

We're not claiming certainty. We're claiming: "Given this evidence and these assumptions, here's where the probability lands."

## What We're Not Claiming

- The probability estimates are not measurements — they're structured judgments
- The framework constrains what's NOT true more than what IS true
- Rejecting one hypothesis doesn't prove a specific alternative
- We could be wrong

## Check Our Work

The methodology is explicit. The reasoning is transparent. The code is available.

If you can show where this breaks, we want to know.

If you can get different results with defensible estimates, we want to see it.

## Extend It

The framework can be applied to any question with:

- A testable hypothesis
- Multiple evidence domains
- Some empirical data

Fork this. Apply it to your questions. Improve it. The ideas matter more than ownership.
