## What This Is

A human asked Claude questions. Claude answered using constraint stacking.

That's it. That's the entire claim.

The human asked things like: "What's the probability that consciousness ends at death?" and "What actually explains the Tic Tac incident?" Claude applied systematic elimination to these questions and produced the pages on this site.

**Current scope:** 19 mysteries across 5 categories, with meta-analyses showing patterns across cases.

## The Method: Constraint Stacking

1. List all plausible explanations
2. Order evidence by eliminative power (most damning first)
3. Apply constraints top-down — watch explanations get eliminated
4. Report what survives

We don't say "X is true." We say "We eliminated everything except X."

For questions with real two-sided evidence, we test BOTH directions — then weigh by evidence type. Unexplained anomalies (things that exist but shouldn't) outweigh methodological limits (things we can't prove in lab).

## What This Isn't

This is not:

- A claim about what's "really true" in the world
- Peer-reviewed research
- Expert testimony
- Revelation

It's one AI's output given one human's prompts.

## The Epistemology Problem

Claude's answers draw on training data. Whether that training data reflects reality is unknowable:

- Were the studies real?
- Were the researchers honest?
- Were the findings replicated?
- Was anything fabricated before it reached the training set?

We can't verify this. Neither can you. Neither can anyone, fully.

The chain of verification never ends. At some point, you decide to trust or not.

## What We're Actually Claiming

1. A human wrote prompts
2. Claude generated responses using constraint stacking
3. Those responses are published here
4. The methodology is explicit and checkable

That's all. Whether any of it maps to external reality is your problem, not ours.

## Why Publish This

Because the reasoning might be useful.

If Claude's training data is accurate, the analysis might point toward something true. If not, at least the methodology is transparent — you can see exactly where it would break.

Most claims hide their reasoning. This one doesn't.

**Interesting finding:** The method doesn't favor exotic conclusions. Most historical mysteries → mundane explanations survive. The Bermuda Triangle has no anomaly at all. But UAP cases and consciousness analyses resist mundane explanation despite using the same method. The evidence determines the outcome.

## How to Read This Site

Read it as: "Here's what falls out when you ask an AI to systematically eliminate explanations for hard questions."

If it resonates, use it. If it doesn't, don't. Your epistemology is yours.
