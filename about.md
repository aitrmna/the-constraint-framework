## What This Is

A systematic method for comparing competing explanations through predictive testing.

**Core idea:** Every hypothesis makes predictions. Check those predictions against reality. Score the results. Compare objectively.

This site documents the framework and applies it to real mysteries.

---

## The Method

**The Constraint Framework:**

1. List all serious hypotheses
2. Generate predictions for each
3. Check predictions against evidence
4. Score confirmations vs failures
5. Weight severity of failures
6. Compare hypotheses numerically

**Result:** Objective ranking showing which hypotheses survive scrutiny.

Not claiming absolute truth. Showing **which explanations fit the evidence better.**

## Why It Exists

To provide an **objective, repeatable method** for evaluating competing explanations.

Traditional reasoning fails:
- Possibility bias ("it's possible" → stops there)
- Confirmation bias (only looks for support)
- Motivated reasoning (reaches desired conclusion)
- False equivalence (treats all options as equal)

**The framework forces intellectual honesty:**
- Can't cherry-pick evidence
- Must count failures
- Must weight severity objectively
- Must compare fairly

---

## Track Record

The framework has been applied to:

- **Criminal cases:** JonBenét Ramsey, D.B. Cooper
- **Disease outbreaks:** COVID-19 origin
- **Aviation mysteries:** MH370, Tic Tac UAP
- **Historical events:** Belgian UFO Wave
- **Signal analysis:** Wow! Signal

**Results range from overwhelming clarity to genuine ambiguity** — depending on the evidence available.

## When It Works vs. Doesn't

**Works best when:**
- Physical evidence exists
- Multiple independent witnesses
- Known comparison cases
- Checkable predictions

**Struggles when:**
- No physical evidence
- Single witness only
- Evidence destroyed/lost
- Purely philosophical questions
- Unfalsifiable hypotheses

## What This Isn't

This is **not:**

- A claim about absolute truth
- A belief system
- Trying to convince you of anything
- Claiming to work on all questions
- Producing certainty

This **is:**

- A method for objective comparison
- Transparent about process
- Honest about limitations
- Shows the work
- Reports what survives elimination

---

## Epistemological Foundation

**Based on Karl Popper's falsificationism:**
- Theories can't be proven true
- Theories CAN be proven false
- Science advances by elimination
- Strong theories make risky predictions

**Plus Bayesian reasoning:**
- Start with priors
- Update based on evidence
- Weight by likelihood ratios

**Plus Occam's Razor:**
- Simpler explanations preferred
- BUT only if they explain all evidence
- Complexity penalty = additional assumptions needed

**The framework makes these principles systematic and quantifiable.**

---

## Key Principles

1. **Generate predictions before checking evidence** (prevents post-hoc rationalization)
2. **Count both successes and failures** (no cherry-picking)
3. **Weight severity objectively** (not all failures equal)
4. **Compare numerically** (objective ranking)
5. **Follow evidence over preference** (intellectual honesty)
6. **State confidence accurately** (no false precision)
7. **Update when new evidence emerges** (dynamic, not static)

---

## Limitations

**The framework only works on empirical questions.**

Can't help with:
- Moral philosophy ("what should we do?")
- Aesthetic judgment ("what is beautiful?")
- Pure mathematics ("is this proof valid?")
- Unfalsifiable claims ("are we in a simulation?")
- Future unknowns ("will X happen?")

**This is by design.** The framework draws a clean line between empirical questions (apply framework) and non-empirical questions (use other methods).

**Knowing the difference is wisdom.**

## The Ultimate Test

**The framework itself makes a prediction:**

"If applied rigorously and honestly, it will lead to better conclusions than intuition, motivated reasoning, or confirmation bias."

**Test this prediction:**
- Apply it to cases with known answers
- Compare conclusions to reality
- Track success rate

**If the framework consistently leads you wrong, abandon it.**

**If it leads you right more than alternatives, use it.**

**That's the framework testing itself.**

*Built to make biases visible and reasoning checkable.*

*Not to produce certainty. To produce honest comparison.*
