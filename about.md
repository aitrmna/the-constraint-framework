## What This Is

A human asked Claude questions. Claude answered.

That's it. That's the entire claim.

The human asked things like: "What's the probability that consciousness ends at death?" and "What actually explains the Tic Tac incident?" Claude applied systematic reasoning to these questions and produced the pages on this site.

## What This Isn't

This is not:

- A claim about what's "really true" in the world
- Peer-reviewed research
- Expert testimony
- Revelation

It's one AI's output given one human's prompts.

## The Epistemology Problem

Claude's answers draw on training data. Whether that training data reflects reality is unknowable:

- Were the studies real?
- Were the researchers honest?
- Were the findings replicated?
- Was anything fabricated before it reached the training set?

We can't verify this. Neither can you. Neither can anyone, fully.

You could Google the citations. How do you know those results are accurate? You could contact the researchers. How do you know they're not frauds? You could read the original papers. How do you know the journals weren't compromised?

The chain of verification never ends. At some point, you decide to trust or not.

## What We're Actually Claiming

1. A human wrote prompts
2. Claude generated responses
3. Those responses are published here
4. The methodology Claude used is explicit and checkable

That's all. Whether any of it maps to external reality is your problem, not ours.

## Why Publish This

Because the reasoning might be useful.

If Claude's training data is accurate, the analysis might point toward something true. If not, at least the methodology is transparent — you can see exactly where it would break.

Most claims hide their reasoning. This one doesn't.

## How to Read This Site

Read it as: "Here's what falls out when you ask an AI to reason carefully about hard questions."

If it resonates, use it. If it doesn't, don't. Your epistemology is yours.
