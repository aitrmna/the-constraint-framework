## What This Is

I got curious. Asked Claude questions. Claude answered using constraint stacking.

That's it.

I asked things like: "What survives when you actually test both directions on consciousness?" and "What explains the Tic Tac if you eliminate what doesn't fit?" Claude applied systematic elimination and produced the pages on this site.

**Current scope:** 20 mysteries across 5 categories, with meta-analyses showing patterns across cases.

## Why It Exists

**Curiosity.**

Not to prove anything. Not to convert anyone. Just to see what falls out when you apply rigorous elimination to hard questions.

Some mysteries dissolve into mundane explanations (Bermuda Triangle — no anomaly at all). Some resist every mundane explanation thrown at them (Tic Tac — five sensor systems, physics-breaking acceleration). Both results are interesting.

The goal isn't answers. The goal is *better questions*.

## The Method: Constraint Stacking

1. List all plausible explanations
2. Order evidence by eliminative power (most damning first)
3. Apply constraints top-down — watch explanations get eliminated
4. Test both directions when warranted
5. Weigh by evidence type (unexplained anomalies > methodological limits)
6. Report what survives

We don't say "X is true." We say "We eliminated everything except X."

And when genuine puzzles remain on both sides, we say that too. Intellectual honesty means acknowledging what you can't fully explain, not just what the other side can't explain.

## What This Isn't

This is not:

- A claim about what's "really true" in the world
- Peer-reviewed research
- Expert testimony
- A belief system
- Trying to convince you of anything

It's Claude's output given my prompts, shared because the process of inquiry was interesting.

## The Epistemology Problem

Claude's answers draw on training data. Whether that training data reflects reality is unknowable:

- Were the studies real?
- Were the researchers honest?
- Were the findings replicated?
- Was anything fabricated before it reached the training set?

I can't verify this. Neither can you. Neither can anyone, fully.

The chain of verification never ends. At some point, you decide to trust or not.

## What I'm Actually Claiming

1. I wrote prompts
2. Claude generated responses using constraint stacking
3. Those responses are published here
4. The methodology is explicit and checkable
5. The reasoning might be interesting to think about

That's all. Whether any of it maps to external reality is your problem, not mine.

## The Pattern That Emerged

Interestingly, the method doesn't favor exotic conclusions:

- Most historical mysteries → mundane explanations survive
- Most signals → natural or human sources
- Bermuda Triangle → no anomaly exists at all

But when the same method hits UAP, consciousness, and foundations:

- All UAP cases → non-human technology survives
- All consciousness analyses → non-materialism survives
- Foundations → "just coincidence" doesn't survive

Same method, different results. The evidence determines the outcome.

**That's what makes it interesting** — not that it confirms any particular worldview, but that the pattern raises questions worth sitting with.

## How to Read This Site

Read it as: "Here's what falls out when you ask an AI to systematically eliminate explanations for hard questions."

If it sparks curiosity, good. If it changes how you think about something, good. If you disagree and can point to why, even better.

The point isn't to be right. The point is to *think*.
